Section I. The General Provisions 
Subsection 1. The Basic Provisions 
Chapter 1. The Civil Legislation 
Article 1. Chief Principles of the Civil Legislation 
1. The civil legislation shall be based on recognizing the equality of participants in the relationships 
regulated by it, the inviolability of property, the freedom of agreement, the inadmissibly of anybody's 
arbitrary interference into the private affairs, the necessity to freely exercise the civil rights, the guarantee 
of the reinstatement of the civil rights in case of their violation, and their protection in the court. 
2. The citizens (natural persons) and the legal entities shall acquire and exercise their civil rights of 
their own free will and in their own interest. They shall be free to establish their rights and duties on the 
basis of an agreement and to define any terms of the agreement, which are not in contradiction with 
legislation. 
The civil rights may be restricted on the basis of the Federal Law and only to the extent, to which it 
shall be necessary for the purposes of protecting the foundations of the constitutional system, morality, 
the health, the rights and the lawful interests of other persons, of providing for the defence of the country 
and for the state security. 
3. The commodities, services and financial means shall move unhindered throughout the entire 
territory of the Russian Federation. Restrictions on the movement of commodities and services shall be

Article 2. Relations Regulated by the Civil Legislation 
1. The civil legislation shall define the legal status of the participants in the civil turnover, the 
grounds for the emergence and the order of exercising the right of ownership and the other rights of 
estate, the exclusive right to the results of the intellectual activity (intellectual property); it shall regulate 
the contractual and other obligations, as well as the other property and personal non-property relations 
related to the former, based on the equality, the autonomous will and the property independence of their 
participants. 
Both the citizens and the legal entities may be the participants of the relations, regulated by the civil 
legislation. The Russian Federation, the subjects of the Russian Federation and the municipal entities may 
also participate in the relations, regulated by the civil legislation (Article 124). 
The civil legislation shall regulate relations between the persons, engaged in business activities or in 
those performed with their participation, proceeding from the fact that the business activity shall be an 
independent activity, performed at one's own risk, aimed at systematically deriving a profit from the use 
of the property, the sale of commodities, the performance of work or the rendering of services by the 
persons, registered in this capacity in conformity with the law-established procedure. 
The rules, laid down by the civil legislation, shall be applied toward relations with the participation 
of foreign citizens, of persons without any citizenship, and also of foreign legal entities, unless otherwise 
stipulated by the Federal Law. 
2. The inalienable human rights and freedoms, and the other non-material values shall be protected 
by the civil legislation, unless otherwise following from the substance of these non-material values. 
3. Unless otherwise stipulated by legislation, the civil legislation shall not be applied toward the 
property relations, based on the administrative or the other kind of authoritative subordination of one 
party to the other party, including toward the taxation and other financial or administrative relations.

Legislation Norms

Russian Federation proves to be in contradiction with the present Code or with the other law, the present 
Code or the corresponding law shall be applied.

President of the Russian Federation and in the decisions of the Government of the Russian Federation

7. The ministries and the other federal executive power bodies may issue the acts, containing the 
norms of the civil law, in the cases and within the limits, stipulated by the present Code, by the other laws 
and by the other legal acts. 
Article 4. Operation of the Civil Legislation in Time 
1. The acts of the civil legislation shall not be retroactive and shall be applied toward the relations, 
which have arisen after they have been put in force. 
The operation of the law shall be extended toward the relations, which have arisen before it has been 
put in force, only in the cases, directly stipulated by law. 
2. Concerning the relations, which have arisen before the civil legislation act has been put in force, 
it shall be applied toward the rights and duties, which have arisen after its being put in force. The relations

regulated in conformity with Article 422 of the present Code. 
Article 5. The Customs of the Business Turnover

substance, the civil legislation shall be applied, which regulates similar relations (the analogy of the law).

subsequent certification of the deal shall be required.

its parties. 
The invalidity of the creditor's claims against one of the persons, participating in the obligation on 
the side of the debtor, the same as the expiry of the term of the limitation of actions by the claim against 
such a person, shall not of themselves have a bearing on his claims against the rest of these persons. 
2. If each of the parties by the contract shall bear a duty in favour of the other party, it shall be 
regarded as the debtor of the other party by what it is obliged to do in its favour, and simultaneously as its 
creditor by what it has the right to claim from it. 
3. The obligation shall not create the duties for the persons, who do not participate in it in the 
capacity of the parties (for the third persons). 
In the cases, stipulated by the law, by the other legal acts or by an agreement between the parties,

the terms of the obligation or from its substance. In this case the creditor shall be obliged to accept the 
discharge, offered by the third person instead of by the debtor. 
2. The third person, undergoing the threat of losing his right to the property of the debtor (the right

secured against by the pledge, because of the circumstances, for which he is answerable. 
2. The claim for turning the penalty onto the pledged property may be rejected, if the violation, 
committed by the debtor with respect to the obligation, secured against by the pledge, is utterly 
insignificant, and for this reason, the amount of the pledger's claims is obviously out of all proportion 
with the cost of the pledged property. 
Article 349. Procedure for Turning the Penalty onto the Pledged Property

property by the court decision.

turning to the court shall be admitted on the grounds of a notarially certified agreement of the pledgee 
with the pledger, concluded between them after the arising of the grounds for turning the penalty onto the 
object of pledge. This agreement may be recognized by the court as invalid upon the claim of the person, 
whose rights have been violated by such an agreement. 
2. The pledgee's rights shall be satisfied at the expense of the pledged movable property by the court 
decision, unless otherwise stipulated by the agreement of the pledger with the pledgee. However, the

of cultural value for society;

the present Code, the penalty has been turned, shall be effected by way of selling it at an open auction in 
the order, established by the procedural legislation, unless otherwise laid down by the law. 
2. Upon the request of the pledger, the court shall have the right, in its decision on turning the 
penalty onto the pledged property, to postpone its sale at an open auction for a term of up to one year. The 
delay shall not concern the parties' rights and duties by the obligation, secured against by the pledge of 
this property, and shall not absolve the debtor from recompensing the creditor's losses and the forfeit, 
both of which have mounted over the period of delay. 
3. The initial selling price of the pledged property, from which the bidding starts, shall be fixed by 
the court decision in the cases, when the penalty has been turned onto the property through the court, or 
by an agreement, concluded between the pledgee and the pledger - in the rest of cases. 
The pledged property shall be sold to the person, who offers the highest price at the auction. 
4. In case the auction is declared as having failed, the pledgee shall have the right, by an agreement 
with the pledger, to acquire the pledged property and to offset the selling price by the amount of his 
claims, secured against by the pledge. To such an agreement, the rules of the purchase and sale shall be 
applied. 
In case the repeatedly held auction is declared as having failed, too, the pledgee shall have the right 
to keep the object of pledge to himself, while appraising its cost at an amount, which is not over 10 per 
cent lower than its initial selling price at the repeatedly held auction. 
If the pledgee has not availed himself of the right to keep the object of pledge to himself within one 
month from the day of declaring the repeated auction as having failed, the contract of pledge shall be 
terminated. 
5. If the amount, derived from the realization of the pledged property, proves to be insufficient to 
cover the pledgee's claim, he shall have the right, in the absence of any other instruction in the law or in 
the contract, to obtain the underderived amount from the other property of the debtor, while not enjoying 
the right of priority, based on the pledge. 
6. If the amount, derived from the realization of the pledged property, exceeds the size of the 
pledgee's claim, secured against by the pledge, the difference shall be returned to the pledger. 
7. The debtor and the pledger, who is the third person, shall have the right, at any time before the 
sale of the object of pledge, to terminate the turning onto it of the penalty and its realization by 
discharging the obligation, secured against by the pledge, or that part thereof, whose discharge has been 
delayed. An agreement, restricting this right, shall be regarded as insignificant.

2) if the pledger has not discharged the duties, stipulated by Subitems 1 and 2 of Item 1 and by Item 
2, Article 343 of the present Code;

duties, unless otherwise stipulated by the agreement with the pledgee.

succession, to several persons, each one of the legal successors (acquirers of the property) shall bear the 
consequences, following from the non-discharge of the obligation, secured against by the pledge, in 
proportion to that part of the said property, which has passed to him. However, in case the object of 
pledge is indivisible or remains in the common ownership of the legal successors, they shall become joint 
pledgers.

Property 
1. If the pledger's right of ownership to the property, which is the object of pledge, is terminated on 
the grounds and in the way, established by the law, as a result of the withdrawal (redemption) for the state 
or for the municipal needs, of the requisition or of the nationalization, and if the pledger is given the other 
property or the corresponding compensation, the right of pledge shall be extended to the new property, 
given instead of the old property, or the pledgee shall correspondingly acquire the right of priority in the 
satisfaction of his claim from the amount of the compensation due to the pledger. The pledgee shall also 
have the right to claim an advanced discharge of the obligation, secured against by the pledge.

the rights of claim against the debtor by the principal obligation, secured against by the pledge, have also 
been ceded to the same person.

cession of the rights by the obligation, secured against by the mortgage.

the creditor on the terms, stipulated by the obligation. This right shall cease to exist, if the thing has

operation management. If the thing has not yet been transferred, the right of priority shall belong to that 
creditor, with respect to whom the obligation has arisen at an earlier date, and if this is impossible to

claim against the principal debtor.

regress to the principal debtor, or by an indisputable recovery of the means involved from the principal 
debtor. 
3. The person, bearing the subsidiary liability, shall be obliged, before satisfying the claim, 
presented against him by the creditor, to warn about it the principal debtor, and if the claim has been filed 
against such a person - to draw the principal debtor into the court case. Otherwise, the principal debtor 
shall have the right to put forward against the claim of regress of the person, bearing the subsidiary 
liability, the objections, which he has had against the creditor.

part), with the exception of the cases, when the other grounds of the responsibility have been stipulated by 
the law or by the contract.

3. Unless otherwise stipulated by the law or by the contract, the person, who has failed to discharge, 
or has discharged in an improper way, the obligation, while performing the business activity, shall bear 
responsibility, unless he proves that the proper discharge has been impossible because of a force-majeure, 
i.e., because of the extraordinary circumstances, which it was impossible to avert under the given 
conditions. To such kind of circumstances shall not be referred, in particular, the violations of obligations 
on the part of the debtor's counter-agents, or the absence on the market of commodities, indispensable for

or through carelessness contributed to the increase of the losses, caused by the non-discharge or by an 
improper discharge, or if he has not taken reasonable measures to reduce them. 
2. The rules of Item 1 of the present Article shall also be correspondingly applied in the cases, when

the other legal acts, or by the contract, or those stemming from the customs of the business turnover or 
from the substance of the obligation, before the performance of which the debtor could not have 
discharged his obligation. 
The creditor shall also be regarded as guilty of the delay in the cases, pointed out in Item 2 of 
Article 408 of the present Code. 
2. The creditor's delay shall give to the debtor the right to the compensation of losses, caused to him 
by the said delay, unless the creditor proves that the delay has occurred through the circumstances, for

counted upon when concluding the contract. 
3. In case of the unilateral refusal to discharge the contract in full or in part, when such refusal is 
admitted by the law or by the agreement between the parties, the contract shall be correspondingly 
regarded as cancelled or as amended. 
On the additional grounds for amendment and cancellation of the contract see Federal Law No. 6-FZ 
of January 8, 1998  
Article 451. The Amendment and the Cancellation of the Contract Because of 
an Essential Change of Circumstances 
1. An essential change of the circumstances, from which the parties have proceeded when 
concluding the contract, shall be the ground for its amendment or cancellation, unless otherwise stipulated 
by the contract or following from its substance. 
The change of the circumstances shall be recognized as essential, if they have changed to such an 
extent that in case the parties could have wisely envisaged it, the contract would not have been concluded 
by them or would have been concluded on the essentially different terms. 
2. If the parties have failed to reach an agreement on bringing the contract into correspondence with 
the essentially changed circumstances or on its cancellation, the contract may be cancelled, and on the 
grounds, stipulated by Item 4 of the present Article, it may be amended by the court upon the claim of the 
interested party in the face of the simultaneous existence of the following conditions: 
1) at the moment of concluding the contract, the parties have proceeded from the fact that no such 
change of the circumstances will take place; 
2) the change of the circumstances has been called forth by the causes, which the interested party 
could not overcome after they have arisen, while displaying the degree of care and circumspection, which 
have been expected from it by the nature of the contract and by the terms of the circulation; 
3) the execution of the contract without amending its provisions would so much upset the balance of 
the property interests of the parties, corresponding to the contract, and would entail such a loss for the 
interested party that it would have been to a considerable extent deprived of what it could have counted 
upon when concluding the contract; 
4) neither from the customs of the business turnover, nor from the substance of the contract does it 
follow that the risk, involved in the change of the circumstances, shall be borne by the interested party. 
3. In case of the cancellation of the contract because of the essentially changed circumstances, the 
court shall, upon the claim of any one of the parties, define the consequences of the cancellation of the 
contract, proceeding from the need to justly distribute the expenses, borne by them in connection with the 
execution of this contract, between the parties. 
4. The amendment of the contract in connection with an essential change of the circumstances shall 
be admitted by the court decision in extraordinary cases, when the cancellation of the contract contradicts 
the public interests, or if it entails the losses for the parties, considerably exceeding the expenses, 
necessary for the execution of the contract on the terms, amended by the court. 
Article 452. The Procedure for the Amendment and the Cancellation of the 
Contract 
1. The agreement on the amendment or on the cancellation of the contract shall be legalized in the 
same form as the contract itself, unless otherwise following from the law, from the other legal acts, from 
the contract or from the customs of the business turnover. 
2. The claim for the amendment or for the cancellation of the contract may be filed by the party with 
the court only after it has received the refusal from the other party in response to its proposal to amend or 
to cancel the contract, or in case of its non-receipt of any response within the term, indicated in the 
proposal or fixed by the law or by the contract, and in the absence thereof - within a 30-day term. 
Article 453. The Consequences of the Amendment and of the Cancellation of 
the Contract 
1. In case of the amendment of the contract, the parties' obligations shall be preserved in the 
amended form. 
2. In case of the cancellation of the contract, the parties' obligations shall be terminated. 
3. In case of the amendment or of the cancellation of the contract, the obligations shall be regarded 
as amended or as terminated from the moment of the parties' concluding an agreement on the amendment 
or on the cancellation of the contract, unless otherwise following from the agreement or from the nature 
of the contract's amendment, and in case of the amendment or the cancellation of the contract by the court 
decision - from the moment of the enforcement of the court ruling on the amendment or on the 
cancellation of the contract. 
4. The parties shall have no right to claim the return of what has been discharged by them by their 
obligations up to the moment of the amendment or the cancellation of the contract, unless otherwise 
stipulated by the law or by the agreement between the parties. 
5. If an essential violation of the contract by one of the parties has served as the ground for the 
amendment or for the cancellation of the contract, the other party shall have the right to claim the 
compensation of the losses, inflicted upon it by the amendment or by the cancellation of the contract.

registration of the heir's rights to assets of estate where such a right is subject to state registration. 
Article 1153. The Methods of Accepting an Inheritance 
1. An inheritance is accepted by means of the heir's filing an inheritance acceptance application or 
an application for a certificate of the right to the inheritance with the notary or personal representative 
under law at the place of opening of the inheritance. 
If an heir's application is passed to the notary by another person or the signature of the heir is mailed 
on the application shall be attested by a notary, an official empowered to accomplish notarial actions 
(Item 7 of Article 1125) or a person empowered to attest powers of attorney in compliance with Item 3 of 
Article 185 of the present Code). 
An inheritance can be accepted through a representative if the power of accepting an inheritance is 
specifically established in powers of attorney. No powers of attorney are required for a personal 
representative to accept an estate. 
2. Until and unless the contrary is proven, an heir shall be deemed to have accepted an inheritance if 
he has committed actions evidencing an actual acceptance of the inheritance, in particular, if the heir: 
has commenced possession or administration of assets of the estate; 
has taken measures for preserving assets of the estate, protecting it against third persons' 
encroachments or claims; 
has incurred expenses on his account towards maintenance of assets of the estate; 
has paid the testator's debts or received from third persons amounts of money payable to the testator.

If the inheritance is opened on the date of the alleged death of a citizen (Item 1 of Article 1114) the 
inheritance can be accepted within six months after the date when the court decision whereby the citizen 
is announced dead becomes final. 
2. If a right of inheritance emerges for other persons as the result of an heir's disclaimer of an 
inheritance or an heir's disqualification on the grounds established by Article 1117 of the present Code 
such person can accept the inheritance within six months after the date of occurrence of their right of 
inheritance. 
3. Persons whose right of inheritance occurs only due to an heir's non-acceptance of an inheritance 
can take the inheritance within three months after the expiry of the term specified in Item 1 of the present 
article. 
Article 1155. Acceptance of an Inheritance upon the Expiry of the Established 
Term 
1. On the application filed late by a heir as concerning the term set for acceptance of an inheritance 
(Article 1154) the court may reinstate the term and recognise the heir as having accepted the inheritance if 
the heir did not know and was not supposed to know of the opening of the inheritance or if the heir has 
missed the term due to other legitimate reasons and on the condition that the heir who missed the term set 
for acceptance of the inheritance has filed his/her application with the court within six months after the 
time when the causes/reasons for the lateness ceased to exist. 
Having recognised an heir as having accepted an inheritance, the court shall determine the shares of 
all the heirs in the estate and if necessary shall designate measures for safeguarding the rights of the new 
heir to his/her entitlement (Item 3 of the present Article). The certificates of a right of inheritance issued 
earlier shall be recognised by the court as void. 
2. An heir can accept an inheritance after the expiry of the term set for the acceptance thereof 
without resorting to the court if all the other heirs who have accepted the inheritance grant their consent 
thereto in writing. If such a written consent is granted by heirs in the absence of a notary, their signatures 
on the documents whereby the consent is granted shall be attested in the manner specified in Paragraph 2 
of Item 1 of Article 1153 of the present Code. The heirs' consent shall be deemed a ground for a notary to
