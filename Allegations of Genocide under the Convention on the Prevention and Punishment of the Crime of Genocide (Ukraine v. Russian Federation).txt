No. 2025/5
31 January 2025
Allegations of Genocide under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment
of the Crime of Genocide (Ukraine v. Russian Federation)
Counter-claims made by the Russian Federation
THE HAGUE, 31 January 2025. On 18 November 2024, the Russian Federation filed its 
Counter-Memorial, which contained counter-claims, in the case concerning Allegations of Genocide 
under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Ukraine v.
Russian Federation). Ukraine subsequently objected to the admissibility of the counter-claims.
In accordance with Article 80, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court, the Court has invited 
Ukraine and the Russian Federation to submit their views on the matter by 20 May 2025 and 
22 September 2025, respectively. It will then be for the Court to decide whether the counter-claims 
are admissible.

History of the proceedings
On 26 February 2022, Ukraine filed in the Registry of the Court an Application instituting 
proceedings against the Russian Federation concerning “a dispute . . . relating to the interpretation, 
application and fulfilment of the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime 
of Genocide” (the “Genocide Convention”).
Ukraine contends, inter alia, that 
“the Russian Federation has falsely claimed that acts of genocide have occurred in the 
Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts of Ukraine, and on that basis recognized the so-called 
‘Donetsk People’s Republic’ and ‘Luhansk People’s Republic’, and then declared and 
implemented a ‘special military operation’ against Ukraine”.
Ukraine “emphatically denies” that such acts of genocide have occurred and states that it 
submitted the Application “to establish that Russia has no lawful basis to take action in and against 
Ukraine for the purpose of preventing and punishing any purported genocide”.

As basis for the Court’s jurisdiction, Ukraine invokes Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Statute 
of the Court and Article IX of the Genocide Convention, to which both States are parties.
Together with the Application, Ukraine submitted a Request for the indication of provisional 
measures with reference to Article 41 of the Statute of the Court and to Articles 73, 74 and 75 of the 
Rules of Court. By an Order dated 16 March 2022, the Court indicated certain provisional measures.
On 3 October 2022, the Russian Federation raised preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of 
the Court and to the admissibility of the Application. Consequently, in accordance with Article 79bis, 
paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court, the proceedings on the merits were suspended. By an Order dated 
7 October 2022, the Court fixed 3 February 2023 as the time-limit within which Ukraine could 
present a written statement of its observations and submissions on the preliminary objections raised 
by the Russian Federation. Ukraine filed its written statement within the time-limit thus fixed.
Between 21 July 2022 and 15 December 2022, 33 States filed declarations of intervention in 
the case, pursuant to Article 63, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court. By an Order dated 5 June 
2023, the Court decided that the declarations submitted by 32 States were admissible at the 
preliminary objections stage of the proceedings. 
Public hearings on the preliminary objections raised by the Russian Federation were held 
between 18 and 27 September 2023. Thirty-two intervening States presented oral observations at the 
hearings.
On 2 February 2024, the Court rendered its Judgment on the preliminary objections, in which 
it found that it had jurisdiction to examine the claim of Ukraine requesting the Court to “[a]djudge 
and declare that there is no credible evidence that Ukraine is responsible for committing genocide in 
violation of the Genocide Convention in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine”, and that the 
claim was admissible. The case could therefore proceed to the merits.
By an Order also dated 2 February 2024, the Court fixed 2 August 2024 as the time-limit for 
the filing of the Counter-Memorial of the Russian Federation. By Orders dated 30 July 2024 and 
9 September 2024, this time-limit was extended to 16 September 2024 and then to 18 November 
2024.
In a press release dated 6 August 2024, the Court announced that 23 States had filed new or 
adjusted declarations of intervention under Article 63 of the Statute for the purposes of the merits 
stage of the proceedings, or had indicated their intention to maintain their declarations of intervention 
filed at the preliminary objections stage, without adjustments. One such State, Poland, has also filed
an application for permission to intervene under Article 62 of the Statute.
