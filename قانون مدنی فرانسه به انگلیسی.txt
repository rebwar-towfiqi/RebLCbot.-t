       (Act no 95-125 of 8 Feb. 1995) A minor between sixteen and eighteen who is prevented from expressing his
 intention by an impairing of his mental or bodily faculties must be likewise represented. The impediment shall be
 established by the judge of guardianships of his own motion, on application of a member of the family of the minor or of
 the Government procurator's office, upon presentation of a certificate issued by a specialist selected on a list drawn out
 by the Government procurator.
       (Act no 95-125 of 8 Feb. 1995) Where the minor mentioned in the preceding paragraph is placed under

 1814 and who transferred their domiciles in France later than this Treaty, were not allowed to acquire  French nationality
 on this ground unless they complied with the provisions of the Act of 14 October 1814. French persons who were born
 outside the retroceded territories and have kept their domiciles on those territories have not lost French nationality under
 the terms of the aforementioned Treaty.

       Provided that there is no infringement of the interpretation given to former agreements, a change of nationality may

 the ground of the apparent nationality of the child.

 nationality. The foreign spouse must also prove a sufficient knowledge of the French language, according to his or her
 condition.
       The duration of the community of living shall be raised to three years where the alien, at the time of the declaration,

 Articles 30 to 30-4
       The burden of proof in matters of French nationality lies on the person whose nationality is in dispute.
       However, this burden lies on him who challenges the status of French of a person who holds a certificate of French
 nationality issued as provided for in Articles 31 and following.
 Art. 30-1
 (Ord. no 45-2441 of 19 Oct. 1945)
       Where French nationality is granted or acquired in another way than declaration, naturalisation, reinstatement or

 Art. 30-2
 (Act no 61-1408 of 22 Dec. 1961)
       However, where French nationality may flow only from parentage, it shall be deemed established, saving proof to
 the contrary, if the person concerned and the parent who was likely to transmit it to him have in a constant way enjoyed
 the apparent status of French.
       (Act no 93-933 of 22 July 1993) French nationality of persons born in Mayotte, of age on 1 January 1994, shall be
 alternatively deemed established if those persons have in a constant way enjoyed the apparent status of French.

       Where a person usually resides or resided in a foreign country, in which the ancestors from whom he holds
 nationality by parentage have settled for more than half a century, that person shall not be allowed to prove that he has
 French nationality by parentage if himself or the parent who was likely to transmit it to him have not enjoyed the
 apparent status of French.
       In that event, the court shall have to record the loss of French nationality under Article 23-6.
 Art. 30-4
 (Act no 73-42 of 9 Jan. 1973)
       Apart from loss or forfeiture of French nationality, proof of the alien status of a person may only be established by
 evidencing that the party concerned does not fulfil any of the statutory requirements for having the status of French.

 provision under which the party concerned has the status of French as well as the documents which allowed its being
 drawn up. It shall prevail until evidence contrary to it.
       (Act no 95-125 of 8 Feb. 1995) For the issuing of a certificate of nationality, the chief clerk of a tribunal d'instance
 may, failing other elements, presume that the records of civil status drawn up abroad and presented to him produce the
 effects that French law would have attributed to them.
 Art. 31-3
 (Act no 95-125 of 8 Feb. 1995)
       Where the chief clerk of a tribunal d'instance refuses to issue a certificate of nationality, the party concerned may
 refer the matter to the Minister of Justice who shall decide whether there is a case for the performance of that issuing.

       Faith must be given to records of civil status of French persons and aliens made in a foreign country and drawn up

 document is brought, shall delay the request and give notice to the person concerned that he may, within two months,

CIVIL CODE
 (Act of 20 Nov. 1919)
       Declarations of birth shall be made within three days of the delivery, to the local officer of civil status.
       Where a birth has not been declared within the statutory period, the officer of civil status may only record it in his
 registers under a judgment rendered by the court of the arrondissements  in which the child was born, and a summary
 mention shall be made in the margin at the date of the birth. Where the place of birth is unknown, the court having
 jurisdiction shall be the one of the residence of the applicant.
       (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) In foreign countries, declarations to diplomatic or consular agents must be made
 within fifteen days of the delivery. That period may however be extended by decree in some consular districts.
 Art. 56

 surgery, midwives, health officials or other persons present at the delivery; and, where the mother has given birth
 outside her domicile, by the person at whose place she has given birth.
       (Act of 7 Feb. 1924) Records of birth shall be drawn up at once.
 Article 57

 him, the family name, followed if there is occasion by the mention of the joint declaration of the parents as regards the
 choice effected, and the first names, names, ages, occupations and domiciles of the father and mother and, if there is
 occasion, those of the applicant. If the father and mother of the child or one of them are not indicated to the officer of
 civil status, nothing thereon shall be mentioned on the registers.
       The first names of the child are chosen by his father and mother. A woman who asked to keep her identity secret at
 the time of the delivery may make known the first names she desires to be given to the child. Otherwise, or where his
 parents are unknown, the officer of civil status shall choose three first names the last of which takes the place of a family
 name to the child. Any first name entered on the record may be chosen as the usual first name.
       Where these first names or one of them, alone or combined with the other first names or the name appears to him
 to be contrary to the welfare of the child or to the rights of third persons to the protection of their family names, the officer
 of civil status shall give notice thereof to the government procurator* without delay. The latter may refer the matter to the
 family causes judge*.
       Where the judge considers that the first name is not consonant with the welfare of the child or interferes with the
 rights of third persons to the protection of their family names, he shall order its removal from the registers of civil status.
 Where appropriate, he shall give the child another first name which he himself chooses in the absence of a new choice
 by the parents that be consonant with the interests aforesaid. A mention of the judgment shall be entered in the margin
 of the records of civil status of the child.
 Article 57-1
 (Ord. no 2005-759 of 4 July 2005)
       Where the officer of civil status of the place of birth of a child makes mention of the acknowledgement of the
 aforesaid child in the margin of the record of birth of the latter, he shall inform the other parent thereof by registered
 letter with advice of delivery.
       Where this parent may not be informed, the officer of civil status shall inform the government procurator thereof, and
 the latter shall have all the necessary steps taken.
 Art. 58
 (Ord. no 58-779 of 23 Aug. 1958)
       A person who may have found a new-born child is required to make declaration of it to the officer of civil status of
 the place of discovery. Where he does not consent to take charge of the child, he shall hand him, with the clothing and
 other effects found with him, to the officer of civil status.
       A detailed memorandum shall be drawn up which, besides the indications provided for by Article 34 of this Code,
 shall state the date, time, place and circumstances of the discovery, the apparent age and the sex of the child, any
 peculiarities which may contribute to his identification as well as the authority or person to whom he is entrusted. That
 memorandum shall be entered as of its date on the registers of civil status.
       Following and separately from this memorandum, the officer of civil status shall draw up a record that shall take the
 place of a record of birth. Besides the indications provided for by Article 34, that record shall state the sex of the child as
 well as the first names and name that are given to him; it shall fix a date of birth that may tally with his apparent age and
 designate as place of birth the commune where the child was discovered.
       Similar records shall be drawn up, on declaration of the Children's aid services, for children placed under their
 guardianship and deprived of a known record of birth or for whom the secret as to birth has been claimed.
       Copies and certificates of the memorandum of discovery or of the interim record of birth shall be  issued on the
 terms and in accordance with the distinctions under Article 57 of this Code.
       Where the record of birth of the child is found or the birth is judicially declared, the memorandum of discovery and
 the interim record of birth shall be nullified at the request of the Government procurator or of the parties concerned.
 Art. 59
 (Act of 7 Feb. 1924)
       In case of birth during a sea voyage, a record shall be drawn up within  three days of the delivery, upon declaration

 of the father if he is on board.
       (Act of 8 June 1893) Where the birth takes place during a break in port, a record shall be drawn up under the same
 terms if there is an impossibility to communicate with the shore or, if in a foreign country, there is no French diplomatic
 or consular agent vested with the functions of an officer of civil status.
       That record shall be drawn up, to wit: on vessels of the State, by the officer of the Navy commissariat or, in his
 absence, by the captain or one who fulfils his functions; and on other ships by the captain, master or skipper, or one who
 fulfils his functions.
       Mention shall be made of the circumstances among the ones above provided in which the record was drawn up.
       The record shall be entered at the end of the list of the crew.

 before the family causes judge on request of the party concerned or, where the latter is a person under a disability, on
 request of his statutory representative. An adjunction or suppression of first names may be likewise decided.
       Where the child is over thirteen his personal consent is required.
 Art. 61
       A person who establishes a lawful interest may apply for a change of his name.
       The application for a change of name may be made for the purpose of preventing the extinguishment of the name
 borne by an ancestor or a collateral of the applicant up to the fourth degree.
       The change of name shall be authorized by decree.
 Art. 61-1

 indication of the married status of his father and mother or, where the future spouse is a minor, indication of the
 acknowledgement of which he or she was the subject.
       (Act of 11 July 1929) That instrument must not have been issued more than three months before where it was

 Art. 74
 (Act of 21 June 1907)

 affirmative, the date of that contract and the name and place of residence of the notaire who received it.
       (Act of 2 Feb. 1933) Where the documents produced by one of the future spouses do not accord with one another
 as to the first names or the spelling of the names, he shall ask the one whom they concern and, if the latter is a minor,
 his closest ascendants present at the celebration, to declare that the variance results from an omission or a mistake.
       He shall receive from each party, one after the other, the declaration that they wish to take each other as husband

 Art. 112
 Articles 112 to 133 to

 there is presumption of absence.
 Art. 113

 represent the person presumed absentee in the exercise of his rights or in any act which would be his concern, as well

 property shall then be subject to the rules which apply to statutory administration under judicial supervision such as it is

 where appropriate, according to the extent of the property, the sums that should be allocated yearly to the maintenance
 of the family or the household expenses.
       He shall determine how to provide for the settling of children.
       He shall also specify how the expenses of administration as well as, if necessary, the fees that may be granted to
 the person responsible for the representation of the presumed absentee and the administration of his property should be
 settled.
 Art. 115
       The judge may, at any time and even of his own motion, put an end to the task of the person thus designed; he may
 also replace him.
 Art. 116
       Where a presumed absentee is called to a partition, Article 838, paragraph 1, of the Civil Code shall apply.
       However, the judge of guardianships may authorize a partition, even partial, and designate a notaire to undertake it,
 in the presence of the representative of the presumed absentee or of his substitute designated as provided for in Article
 115, where the original representative is himself concerned in the partition. The statement of liquidation is subject to the

 matrimonial regime and particularly as a result of an order obtained under Articles 217 and 219, 1426 and 1429.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Declaration of Absence
 Art. 122
 Articles 122 to 133 to
 143
       When ten years have elapsed since the judgment that established the presumption of absence, either in the manner
 prescribed in Article 112, or on the occasion of one of the judicial proceedings provided for in Articles 217 and 219, 1426
 and 1429, absence may be declared by the tribunal de grande instance, on the application of any person concerned or
 of the Government procurator's office.
       It shall be the same where, failing that establishment, the person will have ceased to appear at the place of his
 domicile or residence, without having been heard from for more than twenty years.
 Art. 123
       Extracts of the application seeking declaration of absence, after being stamped by the Government procurator's
 office, shall be published in two newspapers circulating in the département or, where appropriate, in the country of the
 domicile or last residence of the person who remains unheard froim.
       The court to which the application is referred may in addition order any other measure giving notice thereof in any
 place where it deems it proper.
       Those measures must be carried out by the party who lodges the application.
 Art. 124
       As soon as the extracts have been published, the application must be forwarded, via the Government procurator, to
 the court which shall decide according to the exhibits and documents filed and in consideration of the conditions of the
 disappearance as well as of the circumstances that can explain the lack of news.
       The court may order any complementary measure of investigation and prescribe, if there is occasion, that an
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 27/268
CIVIL CODE
 examination of witnesses be made adversarily with the Government procurator, where the latter is not an applicant, in
 any place which it deems proper, and particularly in the arrondissement  of the domicile, or those of the last residences,
 where they are different.
 Art. 125
       An originating motion may be lodged as early as the year preceding the expiry of the period  provided for in Article
 122, paragraphs 1 and 2. A declaratory judgment of absence shall be handed down at least one year after the
 publication of the extracts of that petition. It shall establish that the person presumed absentee has not reappeared
 during the periods referred to in Article 122.
 Art. 126
       A motion seeking declaration of absence shall be deemed void where the absentee reappears or the date of his
 death happens to be declared, before the handing down of the judgment.
 Art. 127
       Where a declaratory judgment of absence is handed down, extracts thereof shall be published  in accordance with
 the detailed rules provided for in Article 123, within the period fixed by the court. The judgment shall be deemed void
 where it is not published within that period.
       Where the judgment becomes res judicata, its operative part shall be recorded on request of the Government
 procurator on the registers of death of the place of domicile of the absentee or of his last residence. Mention of that
 recording shall be made in the margin of the registers at the date of the judgment declaring the absence; it shall also be
 made in the margin of the record of birth of the person declared absentee.
       Following registration, the judgment is enforceable vis-à-vis third parties who may only obtain rectification in
 accordance with Article 99.
 Art. 128
       A declaratory judgment of absence involves, from the recording, all the effects that an established death of the
 absentee would have had.
       The measures taken for the administration of the property of the absentee in accordance with Chapter I of this Title
 come to an end, save as otherwise decided by the court or, failing which, by the judge who ordered them.
       The spouse of the absentee may marry again.
 Art. 129
       Where an absentee reappears or his existence is proved after the declaratory judgment of absence, annulment of
 that judgment may be sought, on application of the Government procurator or of any party concerned.
       However, where a party concerned wishes to be represented, he may do so only through a counsel regularly
 entitled to practise.
       The operative part of the judgment of annulment shall be published forthwith in accordance with the detailed rules
 provided for in Article 123. Mention of the judgment shall be made, from the time of its publication, in the margin of the
 declaratory judgment of absence and on any register which refers to it.
 Art. 130
       An absentee whose existence is judicially established recovers his property and that he should have received
 during his absence in the condition in which it may be, the proceeds of that which has been transferred or the property
 acquired by way of investment out of the capital or incomes fallen due to him.
 Art. 131
       A party concerned who has induced a declaration of absence by fraud is liable to restore to the absentee whose
 existence has been judicially established the incomes of the property which he would have enjoyed and to remit him the
 legal interests from the day of receipt, without prejudice, where appropriate, to complementary damages.
       Where fraud falls on the spouse of the person declared absentee, the latter is entitled to contest the liquidation of
 the matrimonial regime to which the declaratory judgment of absence has put an end.
 Art. 132
       Marriage of an absentee remains dissolved, even where a declaratory judgment of absence is annulled.

 Art. 149
 (Act of 7 Feb. 1924)
       Where one of the two is dead or is unable to express his or her intention, the consent of the other suffices.

 spouse or the father and mother of the deceased certify the death under oath.
       Where the present residence of the father or mother is unknown, and where he or she has not been heard from for
 one year, the marriage may be celebrated if the child and the parent who consents make declaration of this under oath.

 there is disagreement between the two lineages, that division implies consent.
       (Act of 7 Feb. 1924) Where the present residence of the father and mother is unknown and where they have not
 been heard from for one year, the marriage may be celebrated if the grandfathers and grandmothers, together with the
 child himself, make declaration of this under oath. It shall be likewise where, if one or several grandfathers or
 grandmothers give their consent to the marriage, the present residence of the other grandfathers or grandmothers is
 unknown and they have not been heard from for one year.
 Art. 151
 (Act of 2 Feb. 1933)
       The production of an office copy, reduced to the operative part, of the judgment that declared the absence or
 ordered an examination of witnesses as to the absence of the father and mother, grandfathers or grandmothers of one

 declaration of it under oath before the judge of guardianships of his residence, with the assistance of his clerk, in his
 chambers, and the judge of guardianships shall place it on record.
       The judge of guardianships shall give notice of that oath to the family council which shall rule on the application for

       [repealed]
 Art. 169
 (Act of 8 April 1927)
       The Government procurator of the arrondissement  in which the marriage is to be celebrated may, for serious
 reasons, dispense with public notice and with any period or only with the bill-sticking of the notice.
       (Ord. no 45-2720 of 2 Nov. 1945) He may also, in exceptional cases, dispense the future spouses, or one of them
 only, with the handing over of the medical certificate required by Article 63, paragraph 2.
       The medical certificate may not be demanded to any of the future spouses in case of imminent danger of death of
 one of them, as provided for in Article 75, paragraph 3, of this Code.
 Art. 170
 (Act of 21 June 1907)
       A marriage contracted in a foreign country between French persons and between a French person and an alien is
 valid where it is celebrated in the forms in use in that country, provided it was preceded by the public notice prescribed
 by Article 63, in the Title Of Records of Civil Status, and the French person did not commit a breach of the provisions
 contained in the preceding Chapter.
       (Act of 29 Nov. 1901) It shall be likewise as regards a marriage contracted in a foreign country between a
 Frenchman and an alien (Act no 2003-1119 of 26 Nov. 2003), where it was celebrated by diplomatic agents or by
 consuls of France, in accordance with French legislation.
       Nevertheless, diplomatic agents or consuls may only proceed to the celebration of the marriage between a
 Frenchman and an alien woman in the countries designated by decrees of the President of the Republic.
       (Act no 2003-1119 of 26 Nov. 2003) Except in case of impossibility or where it appears, upon examination of the
 file, that said hearing is not necessary with respect to Article 146 "nor Article 180" (Act no 2006-399 of 4 April 2006),
 diplomatic or consular agents shall, for the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, proceed to hearing
 jointly the future spouses or spouses, according to the circumstances, either at the time of the request for public notice
 under Article 63, or at the time of the issuing of the certificate of marriage, or in case of a request for registration of the
 marriage by a French national. Diplomatic or consular agents may, if necessary, require to have a talk with either one of
 the spouses or future spouses. "They may assign the execution of the common hearing or of the separate talks to one or
 several established officials in charge of civil status. Where one of the spouses or future spouses resides in a country
 different from that of the celebration, they may request the officer of civil status who has authority ratione loci to hear him
 or her" (Act no 2006-399 of 4 April 2006 ). They may also demand that the spouses or future spouses be present on the
 occasion of each one of the above mentioned formalities.
 Art. 170-1
 (Act no 93-1027 of 24 Aug. 1993)
       Where there is serious circumstantial evidence giving rise to the presumption that a marriage celebrated abroad
 incurs annulment under "Articles 180, 184 or 191" (Act no 2006-399 of 4 April 2006), the diplomatic or consular agent in
 charge of the registration of the record shall immediately inform the Government procurator's office and defer the
 registration.
       The Government procurator shall rule upon the registration. Where he claims annulment of the marriage, he shall
 order that the registration be limited to the only purpose of referring the matter to the court; until the judgement of the
 latter, an office copy of the registered record may be issued only to judicial authorities or with the authorization of the
 Government procurator
       Where the Government procurator did not come to a decision within a period of six months after the reference, the
 diplomatic or consular agent shall register the record..
 Art. 171
 (Act no 59-1583 of 31 Dec. 1959)
       The President of the Republic may, for grave reasons, authorize the celebration of the marriage where one of the
 future spouses is dead after the completion of the official formalities indicating unequivocally his or her consent.
       In this case, the effects of the marriage  date back to the day preceding that of the death of the spouse.
       However, this marriage may not involve any right of intestate succession to the benefit of the survivor and no
 matrimonial regime is considered to have existed between the spouses
                CHAPTER III
                Of Formal Objections to Marriage
 Art. 172
 Articles 172 to 179
       The right to interpose an objection to the celebration of a marriage belongs to the person united by marriage with
 one of the two contracting parties.
 Art. 173
 (Act of 9 Aug. 1919)
       The father, the mother and, in the absence of the father and the mother, the grandfathers and grandmothers may
 interpose an objection to the marriage of their children and descendants, even of full age.
       After a judicial withdrawal of an objection to a marriage interposed by an ascendant, no new objection interposed by

CIVIL CODE
 an ascendant is admissible and may delay the celebration.
 Art. 174
       In the absence of any ascendant, the brother or sister, the uncle or aunt, a cousin-german, of full age, may
 interpose an objection only in the following two instances :
       1° (Act of 2 Feb. 1933) Where the consent of the family council, required by Article 159, was not gained;
       2° Where the objection is based upon the state of insanity of the future spouse; that objection, the withdrawal of
 which may be unconditionally decided by the court, may be accepted only on condition for the objecting party to induce
 a guardianship of adults and gain a decision thereupon within the period fixed by judgment.
 Art. 175
       In the two cases provided for by the preceding Article, the guardian or curator may not, during the continuance of
 the guardianship or curatorship, interpose an objection, unless he is so authorized by the family council, which he may
 convene.
 Art. 175-1
 (Act no 93-1027 of 24 Aug. 1993)
       The Government procurator may interpose an objection in the cases in which he might apply for annulment of a
 marriage.
 Art. 175-2
 (Act no 2003-1119 of 26 Nov. 2003)
       Where there is serious circumstantial evidence giving rise, possibly after holding the hearings provided for in Article
 63, to the presumption that the contemplated marriage may be annulled under Article 146 "or Article 180" (Act no
 2006-399 of 4 April 2006), the officer of civil status may refer the matter to the Government procurator. He shall inform of
 it the persons concerned. [Provisions declared not to conform to the Constitution by decision of the Conseil
 constitutionnel no 2003-484 of 20 Nov. 2003]
       The Government procurator shall, within fifteen days after the matter has been brought before him, either let the
 marriage proceed, or interpose an objection to it, or decide that the celebration must be stayed, pending the inquiry he
 initiates. He shall make his reasoned decision known to the officer of civil status and to the persons concerned.
 [Provisions declared not to conform to the Constitution by decision of the Conseil constitutionnel no 2003-484 of 20 Nov.
 2003]
       The duration of the stay decided by the Government procurator may not exceed one month renewable once by a
 specially reasoned decision.
       After expiry of the stay, the Government procurator shall make known to the officer of civil status by a reasoned
 decision whether he allows the celebration of the marriage or objects to it.
       Either of the future spouses, even minor, may challenge the decision to stay or its renewal before the president of
 the tribunal de grande instance who shall give judgment within ten days. The judgment of the president of the tribunal de
 grande instance may be referred to the court of appeal* which shall decide within the same period.
 Art. 176
 (Act of 8 April 1927)
       An instrument of objection shall state the capacity in which the party objecting is entitled to do so; it shall contain an
 election of domicile at the place where the marriage is to be celebrated ; it shall also contain the reasons of the objection
 and reproduce the text of law on which the objection is based; the whole on pain of nullity and of disqualification of the
 ministerial officer who has signed the instrument containing the objection.
       (Act of 15 March 1933) After one full year, the instrument of opposition ceases to be effective. It may be renewed,
 except in the case referred to in Article 173, paragraph 2, above.
 Art. 177
 (Act of 15 March 1933)
       The tribunal de grande instance shall decide within ten days on an application for withdrawal filed by the future
 spouses, even minors.
 Art. 178
 (Act of 15 March 1933)
       If there is an appeal it shall be disposed of within ten days, and, where the judgment under appeal has granted the
 withdrawal of the objection, the court shall decide even of its own motion.
 Art. 179
       Where an objection is set aside, the parties objecting may be ordered to pay damages, with the exception however
 of the ascendants.
       (Act of 20 June 1896) An application for retrial does not lie against a default judgment which sets aside an objection
 to marriage.
                CHAPTER IV
                Of Applications for the Annulment of a Marriage
 Art. 180
 Articles 180 to 202
       (Act no 2006-399 of 4 April 2006) A marriage contracted without the free consent of the two spouses, or of one of
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 32/268
CIVIL CODE
 them, may be attacked only by the spouses, or by the one whose consent was not free, or by the Government
 procurator*. The use of  coercion on the spouses or one of them, even resulting from reverential fear towards an
 ascendant, constitutes a case of annulment of the marriage.
       (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975) Where there was a mistake as to the person, or as to essential capacities of the
 person, the other spouse may apply for annulment of the marriage.
 Art. 181
 (Act no 2006-399 of 4 April 2006)
       In the case of the preceding Article, the application for annulment may no longer be admissible after a period of five
 years as from the marriage or since the spouse acquired his or her full freedom or the mistake was discovered by him or
 her.
 Art. 182
       A marriage contracted without the consent of the father and mother, of the ascendants or of the family council,
 where this consent was necessary, may be attacked only by those whose consent was required, or by the one of the
 spouses who needed that consent.
 Art. 183
       An application for annulment may no longer be instituted by the spouses or the parents whose consent was
 required, whenever the marriage was expressly or tacitly approved by those whose consent was necessary, or where
 five years has elapsed without claim on their part since they have had knowledge of the marriage. Nor may it be
 instituted by the spouse where five years has elapsed without claim on his or her part, since he or she has reached the
 competent age to consent to the marriage by himself or herself.
 Art. 184
 (Act of 19 Feb. 1933)
       A marriage contracted in violation of the provisions contained in Articles 144, 146,"146-1," (Act no 93-1027 of 24
 Aug. 1993) 147, 161, 162 and 163 may be attacked either by the spouses themselves, or by all those who have an
 interest therein, or by the Government procurator.
 Art. 185
       However, a marriage contracted by spouses who did not yet have the required age, or of whom one of the two had
 not reached  that age, may no longer be attacked :
       1° where six months have elapsed since that spouse or the spouses have reached the competent age;
       2° where the wife, who did not have that age, has conceived before six months elapsed.
 Art. 186
       The father, the mother, the ascendants and the family when they have consented to the marriage contracted in the
 circumstances referred to in the preceding Article, may not be admitted to apply for its annulment.
 Art. 187
       In all cases in which an application for annulment may be instituted, in accordance with Article 184, by all those who
 have an interest therein, it may not be instituted by collateral relatives, or by the children born of another marriage, in the
 lifetime of the spouses, unless they have a vested and present interest.
 Art. 188
       A spouse to whose detriment a second marriage was contracted, may apply for its annulment even during the
 lifetime of the spouse who was bound to him or her.
 Art. 189
       Where the new spouses raise the invalidity of the first marriage, the validity or invalidity of that marriage must be
 judged beforehand.
 Art. 190
       In all cases to which Article 184 applies and under the modifications contained in Article 185, the Government
 procurator may and shall apply for annulment of the marriage, during the lifetime of the spouses, and have them ordered
 to separate.
 Art. 190-1
       [repealed] 
Art. 191
       A marriage which was not publicly contracted and which was not celebrated before the competent public officer,
 may be attacked by the spouses themselves, by the father and mother, by the ascendants and by all those having a
 vested and present interest, as well as by the Government procurator.
 Art. 192
 (Act of 21 June 1907)
       Where a marriage was not preceded by the public notice required or where the dispensations allowed by law were
 not gained, or where the intervals prescribed between the public notice and the celebration were not observed, the
 Government procurator shall have the public officer fined an amount not exceeding"30 francs" (4,5 € ) (Act no 46-2154
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 33/268
CIVIL CODE
 of 7 Oct. 1946) and shall have the contracting parties, or those under whose authority they acted, fined in proportion to
 their wealth.
 Art. 193
       The penalties stated in the preceding Article are incurred by the persons therein named for any infringement of the
 rules prescribed by Article 165, even if those infringements are not held to be sufficient to involve annulment of the
 marriage.
 Art. 194
       No one may claim the quality of spouse and the civil effects of marriage unless he or she produces a record of
 celebration entered on the register of civil status; except in the cases provided for by Article 46, in the Title Of Records
 of Civil Status.
 Art. 195
       Apparent status may not exempt the alleged spouses who respectively avail themselves of it from producing the
 record of celebration of the marriage before the officer of civil status.
 Art. 196
       Where there is an apparent status and the record of celebration of the marriage before the officer of civil status is
 produced, the spouses have respectively no standing to sue for the annulment of that record.
       Art.197
       Where, however, in the case of Articles 194 and 195, there are children born of two persons who have openly lived
 as husband and wife and who are both dead, the legitimacy of the children may not be contested on the sole pretext of
 failure to produce the record of celebration, whenever legitimacy is proved by an apparent status which is not
 contradicted by the record of birth.
 Art. 198
       Where the proof of the lawful celebration of a marriage is established by the outcome of a criminal procedure, the
 entry of the judgment on the registers of civil status secures for the marriage, from the day of its celebration, all civil
 effects, both as regards the spouses and the children born of that marriage.
 Art. 199
       Where the spouses or one of them have died without having discovered fraud, a criminal action may be brought by
 all those who have an interest in having the marriage declared valid, and by the Government procurator.
 Art. 200
       Where a public officer is dead when fraud is discovered, a civil action may be instituted against his heirs, by the
 Government procurator, in the presence of the interested parties and upon their accusation.
 Art. 201
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       A marriage which has been declared  void produces, nevertheless, its effects with regard to the spouses, where it
 was contracted in good faith.
       Where good faith exists only on the part of one spouse, the marriage produces its effects only in favour of that
 spouse.
 Art. 202
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       It also produces its effects with regard to the children, even though none of the spouses was in good faith.
       (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) The judge shall rule on the exercise of parental authority as in matters of divorce.
                CHAPTER V
                Of the Obligations Arising from Marriage
 Art. 203
 Articles 203 to 211
       The spouses contract together, by the sole fact of marriage, the obligation of feeding, supporting and educating their
 children.
 Art. 204
       A child has no claim against his father and mother for a settlement in view of marriage or otherwise.
 Art. 205
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       Children owe maintenance to their father and mother or other ascendants who are in need.
 Art. 206
 (Act of 9 Aug. 1919)
       Sons- and daughters-in-law owe likewise and under the same circumstances, maintenance to their father- and
 mother-in-law, but this obligation ceases where the spouse owing to whom the affinity existed and the children born of
 his or her union with the other spouse are dead.
 Art. 207
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 34/268
CIVIL CODE
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       The obligations resulting from these provisions are reciprocal.
       Nevertheless, where the creditor has failed seriously to fulfil his obligations towards the debtor, the judge may
 discharge the latter from all or part of the maintenance obligations.
 Art. 207-1
       [repealed]
 Art. 208
 (Act no 73-2 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       Maintenance shall be granted only in proportion to the needs of the one who claims it, and to the wealth of the one
 who owes it.
       The judge may, even of his own motion and according to the circumstances of the case, couple the periodical
 payments with a revision clause permitted by the law in force.
 Art. 209
       Where the one who provides or the one who receives maintenance is placed again in such a condition that the one
 can no longer give it, or the other is no longer in need of it, a discharge or reduction of it may be applied for.
 Art. 210
       Where the person who must provide maintenance establishes that he cannot make periodical payments, the"family
 causes judge"(Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) may, with full knowledge of the facts, order that he shall receive in his home,
 feed and maintain the one to whom he owes maintenance.
 Art. 211
       The"family causes judge" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) may also decide whether the father or mother who will offer
 to receive, feed and maintain in his or her home the child to which he or she owes maintenance should  in that case be
 exempted from periodical payments.
                CHAPTER VI
                Of the Respective Rights and Duties of the Spouses
 Art. 212
 (Act no 2006-399 of 4 April 2006)
       Spouses owe each other respect, fidelity, support and assistance.
 Art. 213
 (Act no 70-459 of 4 June 1970)
 Articles 212 to 226
       Spouses are responsible together for the material and moral guidance of the family. They shall provide for the
 education of the children and shall prepare their future.
 Art. 214
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       Where an ante-nuptial agreement does not regulate the contributions of the spouses to the marriage expenses, they
 shall contribute to them in proportion to their respective means.
       [repealed]
       [repealed]
       Where one of the spouses does not fulfil his or her obligations, he or she may be compelled by the other to do so in
 the manner provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 215
 (Act no 70-459 of  4 June 1970)
       Spouses mutually oblige themselves to a community of living.
       (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975) The residence of the family is at the place which they choose by common consent.
       (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965) The spouses may not, separately, dispose of the rights whereby the lodging of the
 family is ensured, or of the pieces of furniture with which it is garnished. The one of the two who did not give his or her
 consent to the transaction may claim the annulment of it: the action for annulment is open to him or her within the year
 after the day when he or she had knowledge of the transaction, without possibility of its ever being instituted more than
 one year after the matrimonial regime was dissolved.
 Art. 216
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       Each spouse has full legal capacity; but his or her rights and powers may be restricted as a consequence of the
 matrimonial regime and of the provisions of this Chapter.
 Art. 217
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       A spouse may be authorized by a court to enter alone into a transaction for which the assistance or the consent of
 the other spouse would be necessary, where the latter is not able to express his or her intention or where his or her
 refusal is not justified by the interest of the family.
       The transaction entered into under the terms of a judicial authorization is effective against the spouse whose
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 35/268
CIVIL CODE
 assistance or consent was lacking, without any personal obligation incumbent on him or her resulting from it
 Art. 218
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       A spouse may give the other a written authorization to represent him or her in the exercise of the powers that the
 matrimonial regime confers to him or her.
       (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) He or she may, in all cases, freely revoke that authorization.
 Art. 219
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       Where one of the spouses is unable to express his or her intention, the other may be judicially entitled to represent
 him or her, in a general manner or for some particular transactions, in the exercise of the powers resulting from the
 matrimonial regime, the terms and extent of that representation being fixed by the judge.
       Failing a legal power, power of attorney or judicial entitlement, the transactions entered into by a spouse in
 representation of the other are effective with regard to the latter according to the rules of management of another’s
 business.
 Art. 220
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       Each one of the spouses has the power to make alone contracts which relate to the support of the household or the
 education of children: any debt thus contracted by the one binds the other jointly and severally.
       Nevertheless, joint and several obligations do not arise as regards expenditures that are manifestly excessive with
 reference to the way of living of the household, to the usefulness or uselessness of the transaction, to the good or bad
 faith of the contracting third party.
       (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) They do not arise either, where they were not concluded with the consent of the
 two spouses, as regards instalment purchases or loans unless those relate to reasonable sums needed for the wants of
 everyday life.
 Art. 220-1
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       Where one of the spouses fails seriously in his or her duties and thus imperils the interests of the family, the"family
 causes judge" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) may prescribe any urgent measure which those interests require.
       He may in particular forbid that spouse to make, without the consent of the other, grants of his or her own property
 and of that of the community, movable or immovable. He may also forbid the displacing of movables, subject to the
 specifying of those which he attributes to the personal use of the one or the other of the spouses.
       (Act no 2004-439  of 26 May 2004 ) Where the violence practiced by one spouse endangers his or her spouse, one
 or several children, the judge may rule on the separate residence of the spouses, specifying which of the spouses shall
 continue to dwell in the conjugal lodging. Save particular circumstances, the enjoyment of this lodging must be attributed
 to the spouse who is not the author of the violence. The judge shall give judgment, if necessary, on the details of
 exercise of parental authority and on the contribution to the marriage expenses. The measures taken lapse where, upon
 expiry of a period of four months from their being handed down, no petition for divorce or judicial separation has been
 lodged. 
       The duration of the other measures taken under this Article must be determined by the judge and may not exceed
 three years, including a possible extension. 
Art. 220-2
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       Where an injunction prohibits the making of grants of property the conveyance of which is subject to registration, it
 must be registered at the suit of the applicant spouse. That registration ceases to be effective upon the expiry of the
 period determined by the injunction, subject for the party concerned to obtain in the interval a varying order, xhich shall
 be given notice of in the same manner.
       Where an injunction prohibits the granting of movables, or the displacing them, it shall be served by the applicant on
 his or her spouse and involves the effect of rendering the latter a responsible custodian of the movables in the same
 manner as a person whose property is seized. Where served on a third party, the latter shall be deemed in bad faith.
 Art. 220-3
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       May be annulled, on claim of the applicant spouse, all transactions entered into in violation of the injunction, where
 they were made with a third party in bad faith, or even with regard to a property the conveyance of which is subject to
 registration, where they are simply subsequent to the registration provided for by the preceding Article.
       An action for annulment may be brought by the applicant spouse within two years after the day when he or she had
 knowledge of the transaction, without possibility of its ever being instituted, where that transaction is subject to
 registration, more than two years after its registration.
 Art. 221
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       Each one of the spouses may open, without the consent of the other, a deposit account and a securities account in
 his or her personal name.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 36/268
CIVIL CODE
       (Act 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) With regard to the depositary, the depositor is always considered, even after
 dissolution of the marriage, to have free disposal of the funds and of the securities on deposit.
 Art. 222
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       Where one of the spouses appears alone to do an act of administration or enjoyment or a grant on a movable which
 he or she holds individually, he or she is considered, with regard to the third party in good faith, to have the power to do
 that act alone.
       This provision shall not apply to pieces of furniture referred to in Article 215, paragraph 3, or to movable tangible
 property the nature of which gives rise to a presumption of ownership of the other spouse in accordance with Article
 1404.
 Art. 223
 (Act 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Each spouse may freely follow a trade, collect his or her earnings and salaries and dispose of them after
 discharging marriage expenses.

 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       The provisions of this Chapter, on all questions where they do not save the application of ante-nuptial agreements,
 apply by the sole effect of marriage, whatever the matrimonial regime of the spouses may be.
                CHAPTER VII
                Of the Dissolution of Marriage
 Art. 227

       (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) One judge of this court shall be assigned to family causes. [deleted]
       This judge has jurisdiction to decree a divorce, whatever the ground for it may be. He may transfer a case as it
 stands for hearings before a division of the court. That transfer is as of right when requested by a party . 
       (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004) He also has exclusive jurisdiction, after divorce has been granted, whatever the
 ground for it may be, to rule on the details of the exercise of parental authority, on the modification of the contribution to
 the support and education of the children and to decide to entrust the children to a third person as well as on revision of
 the compensatory allowance or its terms of payment (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975). He shall then rule informally and
 may be seized by the parties concerned even by a mere petition.

                Of Cases for Divorce
 Art. 229
       Divorce may be decreed in cases either:
       - of mutual consent; or

       - of fault.

 Art. 232
       The judge shall approve the agreement and decree a divorce where he has acquired the belief that the intention of
 each spouse is real and that their consent is free and well informed. 
       He may refuse approval and not decree a divorce where he finds that the agreement insufficiently protects the
 interests of the children or of one of the spouses.

                        Of Divorce Accepted
 Art. 233
 Articles 233 to 235 and
 236
       A petition for divorce may be presented by either spouse or by both where they accept the principle of the
 breakdown of the marriage without consideration of the facts from which it originates.
       This acceptance may not be withdrawn, even through an appeal.

       Where he has acquired the belief that each spouse has given freely his or her consent, the judge shall decree
 divorce and rule upon its consequences.

                        Of Divorce for Irretrievable Impairing of the Marriage Tie
 Articles 237 to 239, 240
 and 241
       A petition for divorce may be presented by a spouse where the marriage tie is irretrievably impaired.
 Art. 238
       An irretrievable impairing of the marriage tie shall result from the ending of the community of life between the
 spouses, where they have been living apart for two years before the summons.
       Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, divorce shall be decreed for irretrievable impairing of the marriage tie in
 the circumstances referred to in Article 246, paragraph 2, where the petition presented on this ground is lodged as a
 reconvention.

                        SECTION IV
                        Of Divorce for Fault
 Articles 242 to 246
       A petition for divorce may be presented by a spouse where facts which constitute a serious or renewed violation of
 the duties and obligations of marriage are ascribable to the other spouse and render unbearable the continuance of
 community life. 
Art. 243
       [repealed]
 Art. 244
 (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975)
       A reconciliation of the spouses which occurred after the alleged facts prevents their being invoked as a ground for
 divorce.
       The judge shall then declare the petition inadmissible. A new petition may however be lodged by reason of facts
 occurred or discovered after the reconciliation, the former facts being then recallable in support of that new petition.
       Temporary continuance or renewal of community life must not be considered as a reconciliation where they result
 only from necessity or from an attempt at conciliation or from the needs of the education of the children. 
Art. 245
 (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975)
       The faults of the spouse who initiated the divorce do not prevent from considering his or her application; they may,
 however, deprive the facts which the other spouse is reproached with of the seriousness that would make them a
 ground for divorce.
       Those faults may be also invoked by the other spouse in support of a counter-petition in divorce. Where both
 applications are granted, divorce is decreed with the blame lying with both spouses.
       Even failing a counter-petition, divorce may be decreed with the blame lying with the two spouses where wrongs
 ascribable to both appear in the hearings.

 Art. 246
       Where a petition on the ground of irretrievable impairing of the marriage tie and a petition on the ground of fault are
 presented concurrently, the judge shall rule first on the petition on the ground of fault.
       Where he dismisses the latter, the judge shall rule on the petition for divorce on the ground of irretrievable impairing
 of the marriage tie.

       The counsels shall then be called to attend the intervieqw and take part in it.
       In the case where the spouse who did not file the petition does not appear at the hearing or is not able to express

 (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975)
 Articles 260 to 287 to
 295
 Articles 260 to 262-2
       A judgment granting divorce dissolves the marriage at the date at which it acquires force of res judicata.
 Art. 261 to 261-2
       [repealed]
 Art. 262
 (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975)
       A divorce judgment is effective against third parties, as regards the property of the spouses, from the day when the
 formalities of mention in the margin, prescribed by the rules which apply to civil status, have been performed.
 Art. 262-1
       A divorce judgment takes effect in the relations between spouses, as regards their property:
       - where it is handed down by mutual consent, as from the date of the agreement which settles all the consequences
 of the divorce, unless the agreement otherwise provides;
       - where it is handed down for acceptance of the principle of the breakdown of the marriage, for irretrievable
 impairing of the marriage tie or for fault, as from the date of the ordonnance de non-conciliation.
       At the request of a spouse, the judge may backdate the effects of the judgment to the date when they ceased to live
 together and collaborate. That request may be brought only on the occasion of the application for divorce. The
 enjoyment of the conjugal lodging by one single spouse keeps a gratuitous character until the ordonnance de
 non-conciliation, save judicial decision to the contrary.
 Art. 262-2
 (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975)
       Any obligation contracted by one of the spouses on the responsibility of the community, any transfer of community
 property made by one of them within the limit of his or her power, after the originating petition, shall be declared void
 where there is evidence that there was fraud on the rights of the other spouse.

 Articles 263 to 276-2
 Articles 263 to 265-2
       Where divorced spouses wish to contract another union between themselves, a new celebration of marriage is
 required.
 Art. 264
       Following divorce, each of the spouses loses the use of his or her spouse's name.
       However, a spouse may keep the use of the other's name, either with his or her consent, or with the authorization of
 the judge, where he or she proves that a particular interest lies therein for him or her or for the children.
 Art. 264-1
       [repealed]
 Art. 265
       Divorce does not affect the matrimonial advantages which take effect during the marriage nor the gifts of existing
 property whatever their form may be.
       Divorce involves by operation of law revocation of the matrimonial advantages which take effect only at the
 dissolution of the matrimonial regime or at the death of one spouse and of the transfers mortis causa, granted by one
 spouse to the other by an ante-nuptial agreement or during the marriage, unless the spouse who granted them
 otherwise decides. This decision must be established by the judge at the time when he decrees divorce and shall render
 irrevocable the upheld advantage or transfer.
 Art. 265-1
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 42/268
CIVIL CODE
       Divorce does not affect the rights which either spouse gets from the law or from contracts entered into with third
 persons. 
Art. 265-2
       During divorce proceedings, spouses may enter into any agreements for the liquidation and partition of their
 matrimonial regime.
       Where liquidation bears on property subject to land registration, the agreement must be drawn up through a notarial
 instrument. 
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of the Consequences Specific to Divorces Other than by Mutual Consent
 Art. 266
 Articles 266 to 268-1
 and 269
       Without prejudice to the application of Article 270, damages may be awarded to one spouse in compensation for
 consequences of a particular seriousness which he or she suffers because of the dissolution of the marriage either when
 he or she was defendant in a divorce granted for irretrievable impairing of the marriage tie and he or she had not
 brought an application for divorce, or where divorce is granted against his or her spouse and the blame lies wholly with
 the latter.
       This claim may be brought only on occasion of an application for divorce.
 Art. 267
       Failing a settlement agreed upon by the spouses, the judge, when he decrees divorce, shall order the liquidation
 and partition of their patrimonial interests.
       He shall rule on the claims for maintenance of undivided ownership or preferential allotment.
       He may also grant to one spouse or both an advance on his share of community or undivided property.
       Where the draft of liquidation of the matrimonial regime drawn up by the notaire appointed under Article 255, 10°,
 contains sufficient information, the judge, upon request of either spouse, shall rule on the enduring disagreements
 between them. 
Art. 267-1
       Where the formalities of liquidation and partition are not completed within one year after the judgment granting
 divorce has become res judicata, the notaire shall forward to the court a report of difficulties recapitulating the respective
 declarations of the parties.
       Upon examination of this report, the court may grant an additional period of six months at the most. 
       Where, upon expiry of that period, the formalities are still uncompleted, the notaire shall inform the court thereof. If
 the changes occurred make it necessary, he shall draw up a new report.
       The court shall rule on the disputes which are still extant between the parties and shall refer them to the notaire for
 him to draw up the statement of liquidation. 
Art. 268
       During  the proceedings, the spouses may submit to the approval of the judge agreements settling all or part of the
 consequences of the divorce. 
       After checking that the interests of each spouse and the welfare of the children are preserved, the judge shall
 approve the agreements when he decrees divorce.
 Art. 268-1 and 269

 Art. 270
                                Paragraph 3
                                Of Compensatory Benefits
       Divorce puts an end to the duty of support between spouses.
 Articles 270 to 276-2
       One of the spouses may be compelled to pay the other a benefit intended to compensate, as far as possible, for the
 disparity that the breakdown of the marriage creates in the respective ways of living. This benefit shall be in the nature of
 a lump sum. It shall take the form of a capital the amount of which must be fixed by the judge.
       However, the judge may refuse to grant such a benefit where equity so demands, either taking into account the
 criteria set out in Article 271, or where the blame lies wholly upon the spouse who requests the advantage of this
 benefit, considering the particular circumstances of the breakdown. 
Art. 271
       A compensatory benefit must be fixed according to the needs of the spouse to whom it is paid and to the means of
 the other, account being taken of the situation at the time of divorce and of its evolution in a foreseeable future.
       For this purpose, the judge shall have regard in particular to:
       - the duration of the marriage; 
       - the ages and states of health of the spouses;
       - their professional qualifications and occupations;
       - the consequences of the professional choices made by one spouse during the community life for educating the

CIVIL CODE
 children and the time which must still be devoted to this education, or for favouring his or her spouse's career to the
 detriment of his or her own;
       - the estimated or foreseeable assets of the spouses, both in capital and income, after liquidation of the matrimonial
 regime;
       - their existing and foreseeable rights;
       - their respective situations as to retirement pensions.
 Art. 272
       In the context of the fixing of a compensatory benefit, by the judge or by the parties, or on the occasion of an
 application for revision, the parties shall provide the judge with declarations stating on their honour the accuracy of their
 means, incomes, assets and ways of living.
       (Act no 2005-102 of 11 Feb. 2005) When determining the needs and means, the judge may not have regard to the
 sums paid on the ground of compensation for industrial injuries and to the sums paid on the ground of the right to
 compensation of a disability.
 Art. 273
       [repealed]
 Art. 274
       The judge shall settle the details according to which a compensatory benefit in capital must be implemented among
 the following forms:
       1° Payment of a sum of money, the divorce judgment being made subject to the establishing of the guarantees
 provided for in Article 277;
       2° Allocation of property for ownership or of a right of use, dwelling or usufruct, temporary or for life, the judgment
 operating a forced transfer in favour of the creditor. However, the consent of the debtor spouse is required to allocate
 the ownership of property which he or she received by succession or gift. 
Art. 275
       Where a debtor is not able to pay the capital under the terms of Article 274, the judge shall fix the modes of
 payment of the capital, within the limit of eight years, in the form of payments made at fixed intervals index-linked in
 accordance with the rules applicable to periodical payments.
       A debtor may request a revision of those modes of payment in case of a considerable change in his or her situation.
 By way of exception the judge may then, by a special judgment setting out the grounds on which it is based, authorize
 the payment of the capital on a total period of more than eight years.
       [repealed]
       A debtor may at any time redeem the balance of the index-linked capital.
       After liquidation of the matrimonial regime, the creditor of a compensatory benefit may refer to the judge a claim for
 payment of the balance of the index-linked capital.
 Art. 275-1
       The modes of payment provided for in Article 275, paragraph 1, are not exclusive of the payment of part of the
 capital in the forms provided for in Article 274.
 Art. 276
       By way of exception, where the age or state of health of the creditor does not allow him or her to supply to his or her
 needs, the judge may, by a special judgment setting out the grounds on which it is based, fix the compensatory benefit
 in the form of a life annuity. He shall have regard to the factors laid down in Article 271.
       The amount of the annuity may be reduced, where circumstances so demand, by the allocation of a fraction in
 capital among the forms provided for in Article 274.
 Art. 276-1
       (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975; Act no 2000-596 of 30 June 2000).- An annuity must be linked to an index; the
 index must be determined as in periodical payments matters.
       The amount of an annuity before index-linking must be fixed in a uniform fashion for its entire duration or may vary
 by successive periods following the likely evolution of needs and means. 
Art. 276-3
       A compensatory benefit fixed in the form of an annuity may be revised, postponed or suppressed in case of an
 important change in the means or needs of either party.
       Revision may not lead to increase the annuity up to an amount superior to the one initially fixed by the judge. 
Art. 276-4
       The debtor of a compensatory benefit in the form of an annuity may at any time refer to the judge an application for
 replacing all or part of the annuity by a capital. The replacement must be effected according to terms established by
 décret en Conseil d'Etat.
       The creditor of a compensatory benefit may submit the same application where he or she establishes that a
 modification in the situation of the debtor allows that replacement, in particular at the time of liquidation of the
 matrimonial regime.
       The details of implementation provided for in Articles 274, 275 and 275-1 shall apply. The refusal of the judge to
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 44/268
CIVIL CODE
 substitute a capital to all or part of the annuity must be specially reasoned. 
Art. 277
 (Act no 2000-596 of 30 June 2000)
       Irrespective of a statutory or judicial mortgage, the judge may order the debtor spouse to establish a pledge, to give
 security or to enter into a contract that guarantees the payment of the annuity or capital.
 Art. 278
       In case of divorce by mutual consent, the spouses shall fix the amount and terms of the compensatory benefit in the
 agreement which they submit to the judge for approval. They may lay down that the payment of the benefit will come to
 an end from the occurrence of a specific event. The benefit may be in the form of an annuity granted for a limited period.
       The judge, however, shall refuse to approve the agreement where it fixes unfairly the rights and obligations of the
 spouses.
 Art. 279
       An approved agreement is enforceable at law as is a judicial decision.
       It may be modified only by a new agreement between spouses, likewise submitted to approval . 
       Spouses have nevertheless the power to provide in their agreement that each of them may, in case of an important
 change in the means or needs of either party, request the judge to revise the compensatory benefit. The provisions of
 Article 275, paragraphs 2 and 3, and of Articles 276-3 and 276-4 shall also apply, depending on whether the
 compensatory benefit takes the form of a capital or of a temporary or life annuity. 
       Save as otherwise provided in the agreement, Articles 280 to 280-2 shall apply.
 Art. 279-1
       Where, pursuant to Article 268, the spouses submit for approval by the judge an agreement relating to a
 compensatory benefit, the provisions of Articles 278 and 279 shall apply. 
Art. 280
       On the death of a debtor spouse, payment of a compensatory benefit, whatever its form may be, must be set apart
 from the succession. Payment must be borne by all the heirs, who may not be liable for it personally, within the limit of
 the assets of the succession, and in case they are insufficient, by all the specific legatees, in proportion to their
 emoluments, subject to the provisions of Article 927.
       Where a compensatory benefit was fixed under the form of a capital to be paid on the terms set out in Article 275,
 the balance of this index-linked capital falls immediately due.
       Where it was fixed under the form of an annuity, a capital falling immediately due must be substituted. Substitution
 must be effected under terms fixed by décret en Conseil d'Etat.
 Art. 280-1
       Notwithstanding Article 280, the heirs may decide together to maintain the forms and arrangements for payment of
 the compensatory benefit which was incumbent on the debtor spouse, by obliging themselves personally to the payment
 of that debt. Under pain of nullity, the agreement must be established by a notarial instrument. It is enforceable against
 third persons from the time when notice of it is given to the creditor spouse where the latter did not intervene in the
 instrument.
       Where the arrangements for payment of a compensatory benefit have been maintained, the claims provided for in
 Article 275, paragraph 2, and in Articles 276-3 and 276-4, depending on whether the compensatory benefit takes the
 form of a capital or of a temporary or life annuity, pertain to the debtor's heirs. The latter may also at any time discharge
 their debt of the balance of the index-linked capital, where the compensatory benefit takes the form referred to in Article
 275, paragraph 1.
 Art. 280-2
       Survivor's pensions possibly paid in the deceased spouse's right must be deducted as of right from the amount of
 the compensatory benefit, where, at the time of the death, it took the form of an annuity. Where the heirs avail
 themselves of the power referred to in Article 280-1, and unless otherwise decided by the judge, a deduction of the
 same amount must still be granted where the creditor loses his or her right or suffers a change in his or her right to a
 survivor's pension.
 Art. 281
       The transfers and surrenders provided for in this Subsection must be deemed dependent on the matrimonial
 regime, whatever their terms of payment may be. They must not be placed on the same footing as gifts.
 Art. 282 to 285
       [repealed]
 Art. 285-1
       If the premises serving as lodging for the family are the separate or personal property of one spouse, the judge may
 grant it on lease to the other spouse who exercises alone or in common parental authority over one or several of their
 children where the latter have their usual residence in these lodgings and their welfare so requires.
       The judge shall fix the duration of the lease and may renew it until the coming of age of the youngest child.
       The judge may terminate the lease where new circumstances so justify.

                        SECTION I
                        Of Cases and Proceedings for Judicial Separation
 Art. 296
 Articles 296 to 309
 Articles 296 to 298
       Judicial separation may be granted on application of one of the spouses in the same cases and subject to the same
 conditions as divorce.
 Art. 297
 (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004)
       A spouse against whom a petition for divorce is filed may make a counterclaim for judicial separation. However,
 where the principal claim for divorce is based on irretrievable impairing of the marriage tie, the counterclaim may be only
 for divorce. A spouse against whom a petition for judicial separation is filed may make a counterclaim for divorce.
       [repealed]
 Art. 297-1
 (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004)
       Where a petition for divorce and a petition for judicial separation are filed concurrently, the judge shall consider first
 the petition  for divorce. He shall decree divorce where its conditions are met. Failing which, he shall rule on the petition
 for judicial separation.
       However, where these petitions are based on fault, the judge shall consider them simultaneously and, if he
 entertains them, he shall decree divorce with respect to the two spouses with the blame lying with both spouses.
 Art. 298
 (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004)
       In addition, the rules contained in Article 228 and in Chapter II above shall apply to the proceedings for judicial
 separation. 
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Consequences of Judicial Separation
 Art. 299
       Judicial separation does not dissolve marriage but it puts an end to the duty of cohabitation.
 Art. 300
 (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004)
 Articles 299 to 304
       Each separated spouse keeps the use of the other's name. Nevertheless, they may be forbidden to do so by the
 judgment of separation or a further judgment, the respective interests of the spouses being taken into account.
 Art. 301
 (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004)
       In case of death of one of the judicially separated spouses, the other spouse shall keep the rights which the law
 grants to a surviving spouse. Where judicial separation is granted by mutual consent, the spouses may include in their
 agreement a renunciation of the rights of succession conferred upon them by Articles 756 to 757-3 and 764 to 766.
 Art. 302
       Judicial separation always involves separation of property.
       Concerning property, the date at which judicial separation takes effect is determined as provided for in Articles 262
 to 262-2.
 Art. 303
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 46/268
CIVIL CODE
       Judicial separation leaves subsisting the duty of support; the judgment which grants it or a further judgment shall fix
 the periodical payments owed to the spouse in need.
       Those payments shall be allotted irrespective of wrongs. The debtor spouse may nevertheless invoke, if there is
 occasion, the provisions of Article 207, paragraph 2.
       (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004) They shall be subject to the rules of maintenance obligations.
       Nevertheless, where the consistency of the property of the debtor spouse so permits, the payments must be
 replaced, in whole or part, by the establishment of a capital, in accordance with the rules of Articles 274 to 275-1, 277
 and 281. Where this capital becomes inadequate to cover the needs of the creditor, the latter may request a
 complement under the form of periodical payments. 
Art. 304
       Subject to the provisions of this Section, the consequences of judicial separation shall obey the same rules as the
 consequences of divorce stated in Chapter III above.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the End of Judicial Separation
 Art. 305
       Voluntary resumption of community life puts an end to judicial separation.
 Articles 305 to 309
       In order to be effective against third parties, it must either be established by a notarial instrument, or be the subject
 of a declaration to an officer of civil status. Mention of it shall be made in the margin of the record of marriage"of the
 spouses, as well as in the margins of their records of birth" (Act no 85-1372 of 13 Dec. 1985).
       Separation of property subsists unless the spouses adopt a new matrimonial regime as provided for in Article 1397.
 Art. 306
       On request of one of the spouses, a judgment of judicial separation shall be converted as of right into a judgment of
 divorce where judicial separation has lasted two years (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004).
 Art. 307
       (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004). In all cases of judicial separation, the latter may be converted into divorce by
 mutual consent.
       Where judicial separation was granted on mutual consent, it may be converted into divorce only by a new joint
 petition.
 Art. 308
       Because of a conversion, the cause for judicial separation becomes the cause for divorce; the allocation of wrongs
 is not changed.
       The judge shall fix the consequences of divorce. The benefits and payments between spouses shall be determined
 according to the rules appropriate for divorce.
 Art. 309
       Divorce and judicial separation are governed by French law :
       - where both spouses are of French nationality;
       - where both spouses have their domicile on French territory;
       - where no foreign law considers it should govern whereas French courts have jurisdiction over a divorce or judicial
 separation case.
        TITLE VII
        OF PARENT AND CHILD  (I) (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972; shall continue in force until
 30 June 2006)

                Provisions Common to Legitimate and Illegitimate Children
                        SECTION I
                        Of Presumptions Relating to Parentage
 Art. 311*
 Articles 311* to 342-8*
 Articles 311* to 311-23*
 Articles 311* to 311-3*
       Legislation presumes that a child was conceived during the period that extends from the three-hundredth to the
 one-hundred and eightieth day, inclusive, before the date of birth.
       Conception is presumed to have taken place at any time during that period, depending of what the welfare of the
 child requires.
       Contrary evidence may be adduced to rebut those presumptions.
 Art. 311-1*
       Apparent status shall result from a sufficient collection of facts showing a bond of parentage and relationship
 between an individual and the family to which he is said to belong.
       Apparent status must be continuous.
 Art. 311-2*
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 47/268
CIVIL CODE
       The main ones of those facts shall be:
       That the individual has always borne the name of those from whom he is said to descend;
       That the latter have treated him as their child, and that he has treated them as his father and mother;
       That they have, in that capacity, provided for his education, support and settling;
       That he is so recognized in society and by the family;
       That public authorities consider him as such.
 Art. 311-3*
       Subject to the conditions provided for in Articles 71 and 72 of this Code he parents or the child may apply to the
 judge of guardianships for an affidavit proving until proof to the contrary the apparent status, without prejudice to any
 other evidence to which they may resort to establish its existence in court, should it be contested. 
       (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) The parental bonds established by an apparent status recorded in an affidavit shall be
 mentioned in the margin of the record of birth of the child.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Actions Relating to Parentage
 Art. 311-4*
       No action is admissible as to the parentage of a child who was not born viable.
 Art. 311-5*
 Articles 311-4* to
 311-13*
       The tribunal de grande instance exercising civil jurisdiction shall have exclusive jurisdiction to have cognisance of
 actions regarding parentage.
 Art. 311-6*
       In case of an offence interfering with the parentage of an individual, a criminal action may be ruled upon only after
 the judgment on the question of parentage has become res judicata.
 Art. 311-7*
       Whenever they are not confined by statute within shorter periods, actions regarding parentage are time-barred after
 thirty years from the day when the individual was deprived of the status that he claims, or began to enjoin the status that
 is contested against him.
 Art. 311-8*
       An action who belonged to an individual as to his parentage may be brought by his heirs only when he died as a
 minor or within five years after his coming of age or his emancipation.
       His heirs may also pursue an action which he had already initiated, unless there was a withdrawal or non-suit.
 Art. 311-9*
       An action regarding parentage may not be the subject of a waiver.
 Art. 311-10*
       Judgments handed down in matters of parentage are enforceable even against persons who were not parties
 thereto; but the latter are entitled to file third party applications for rehearing.
       Judges may of their own motion require that all the parties concerned against whom they consider judgment should
 be given be joined in the action.
 Art. 311-11*
       Likewise, where in one of the actions granted by Articles 340 and 342 below, a defence [repealed] is raised, based
 on the fact that the mother had, during the legal period of conception, intercourse with a third party, the judge may order
 that the latter be joined in the action.
 Art. 311-12*
       The courts shall rule on conflicts of parentages for which legislation did not lay down other guidelines by
 establishing the most probable parentage through any evidence.
       Failing adequate means of conviction, they shall have regard to the apparent status.
 Art. 311-13*
       In the case where they are constrained to dismiss the claim of a party who actually educated a minor child, the
 courts may nevertheless, account being taken of the welfare of the child, grant to that party a right of access.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Conflict of Laws Relating to Parentage
 Art. 311-14*
 Articles 311-14* to
 311-18*
       Parentage is governed by the personal law of the mother on the day of birth of the child; where the mother is
 unknown, by the child's personal law.
 Art. 311-15*
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 48/268
CIVIL CODE
       However, where a legitimate child and his father and mother, or an illegitimate child and one of his father and
 mother have in France their usual common or separate residence, the apparent status has all the consequences it
 produces according to French law, even when the other elements of the parentage may depend upon a foreign law.
 Art. 311-16*
       Marriage involves legitimation where, on the day when the union is celebrated, that consequence is admitted either
 by the law governing the effects of marriage, or by the personal law of one of the spouses, or by the child's personal law.
       Legitimation on the authority of the court is governed, at the choice of the petitioner, either by the personal law of
 the latter, or by the child's personal law.
 Art. 311-17*
       A voluntary acknowledgement of paternity or maternity is valid where it was made in accordance with either the
 personal law of his doer, or the child's personal law.
 Art. 311-18*
       An action for purposes of subsidies is governed, at the choice of the child, by the law of its usual residence or the
 law of the usual residence of the debtor.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Medically Assisted Procreation
 Art. 311-19*
 (Act no 94-653 of 29 July 1994)
 Articles 311-19* to
 311-20*
       In case of a medically assisted procreation with a third party donor, no parental bonds may be established between
 the donor and the child born out of the procreation.
       No action in tort may lie against a donor.
 Art. 311-20*
 (Act no 94-653 of 29 July 1994)
       Spouses or unmarried partners who, in order to procreate, resort to a medical assistance requiring the intervention
 of a third party donor, must, subject to conditions that ensure secrecy, give first their consents to a judge or a notaire
 who shall inform them of the consequences of their act as regards parentage.
       Consent given to a medically assisted procreation prohibits any action for challenging parentage or claiming a
 status unless it is argued that the child was not born out of the medically assisted procreation or that the consent was
 deprived of effect.
       Consent is deprived of effect in case of death, of the filing of a petition for divorce or judicial separation or of
 discontinuance of community life, occurred before the realisation of the medically assisted procreation. It is also
 deprived of effect where the male or the female revokes it in writing and before the realisation of the medically assisted
 procreation, in the hands of the physician in charge of the implementation of that assistance.
       He who, after consenting to medical assistance to procreation, does not acknowledge the child born out of it renders
 himself liable vis-à-vis the mother and child
       Furthermore, may be judicially declared the paternity outside of marriage of him who, after consenting to a medical
 assistance to procreation, does not acknowledge the child born out of it. The action shall comply with the provisions of
 Article 340-2 to 340-6.
                        SECTION V
                        Of the Rules of Devolution of  Family Name
 Art. 311-21*
 (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002)
 (Act no 2003-516 of 18 June 2003)
 Articles 311-21* to
 311-23*
       Where the parentage of a child has been established with regard to his two parents at the latest on the day of
 declaration of his birth or afterwards but simultaneously, the parents shall choose the family name which devolves upon
 him: either the father's name, or the mother's name, or both names coupled in the order they choose within the limit of
 one family name for each of them. Failing a joint declaration to the officer of civil status mentioning the choice of the
 name of the child, the latter shall take the name of the parent with regard to whom his parentage has first been
 established and the father's name where his parentage has been established simultaneously with regard to both.
       Where a child of whom one parent at least is French is born abroad, parents who have not availed themselves of
 the power to choose the name in the way provided for in the preceding paragraph may make such a declaration at the
 time of the registration of the record, at the latest within three years of the birth of the child.
       A name devolving on a first child has effect as to the other common children.
       Where the parents or one of them bear a double family name, they may, by a joint written declaration, transmit only
 one name to their children.
 Art. 311-22*

 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 49/268
CIVIL CODE
 (Act no 2003-516 of 18 June 2003)
       The provisions of Article 311-21 shall apply to the child who becomes French in compliance with Article 22-1, in the
 way provided for by a decree in Conseil d'État.
 Art. 311-23*
 (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002)
 (Act no 2003-516 of 18 June 2003)
       The power to choose provided for in Articles 311-21 and 334-2 may be exercised only once.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Legitimate Children
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Presumption of Paternity
 Art. 312*
       A child conceived in wedlock has the husband as his father.
 Articles 312* to 330*
 Articles 312* to 318-2*
       However, the latter may disavow the child in court, where he proves facts fitted to demonstrate that he cannot be
 the father.
 Art. 313*
       In case of judgment or even of petition, either for divorce or for judicial separation, the presumption of paternity shall
 not apply to a child born more than three hundred days after the order authorizing the spouses to live apart, and less
 than one hundred and eighty days following either the final dismissal of the petition or a reconciliation.
       The presumption of paternity regains however its full force, by operation of law, where the child has the apparent
 status of a legitimate child with regard to the spouses.
 Art. 313-1*
       The presumption of paternity shall be set aside where a child, recorded without indication of the husband's name,
 has an apparent status only with regard to the mother.
 Art. 313-2*
       Where  the presumption of paternity is set aside in the circumstances provided for in the preceding Articles, the
 parentage of a child is established with regard to the mother as if there was a disavowal admitted in court.
       Each one of the spouses may request that the effects of the presumption of paternity be  reinstated by proving that,
 during the statutory period of conception, a de facto relationship took place, that renders probable the paternity of the
 husband."The action may be brought by the child within two years after his coming of age" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan.
 1993).
 Art. 314*
       A child born before the one-hundred and eightieth day of marriage is legitimate and shall be deemed to have been
 so as from his conception.
       The husband, however, may disavow him as provided for in Article 312.
       He may even disavow him on the sole proof of the date of the delivery, unless he knew of the pregnancy before the
 marriage, or behave like the father after the birth.
 Art. 315*
       The presumption of paternity shall not apply to a child born more than three hundred days after the dissolution of
 the marriage or, in case of declared absence of the husband, to the one who was born more than three hundred days
 after the disappearance.
 Art. 316*
       A husband must institute an action in disavowal within six months of the birth, where he is on the spot.
       Where he was not on the spot, within six months from his return.
       And within six months following the discovery of the fraud, where the birth of the child was concealed from him.
 Art. 316-1*
       Where the husband is dead before having instituted the action, but still being within the prescribed period for doing
 so, his heirs are entitled to contest the legitimacy of the child.
       Their action ceases nevertheless to be admissible where six months have elapsed from the time when the child has
 taken possession of property claimed to be paternal, or from the time when the child has disturbed them in their own
 possession.
 Art. 316-2*
       An extra-judicial instrument containing a disavowal on the part of the husband or a contestation of legitimacy on the
 part of the heirs, is void where it is not followed by an action at law within the period of six months.
 Art. 317*
 (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       An action in disavowal shall be directed, in the presence of the mother, against an ad hoc administrator designated
 on behalf of the child by the judge of guardianships in the way provided for in Article 389-3.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 318*
       Even where there is no disavowal, the mother may contest the paternity of the husband, but only for the purpose of
 legitimation, when she remarried with the true father of the child after dissolution of the marriage.
 Art. 318-1*
       On pain of dismissal, an action, directed against the husband or his heirs, must be joined with an application for
 legitimation"brought before the tribunal de grande instance" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993).
       It must be lodged by the mother and her new spouse within six months of their marriage and before the child has
 reached the age of seven years.
 Art. 318-2*
       Judgment is given on the two petitions by one and the same ruling  
       which  may entertain the contestation of legitimacy only where legitimation is admitted.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Proofs of Legitimacy
 Art. 319*
 Articles 319* to 328*
       Parentage of legitimate children is proved by records of birth entered in the registers of civil status.
 Art. 320*
       Failing this instrument, apparent status of a legitimate child is sufficient.
 Art. 321*
       There is apparent status of a legitimate child where it binds the child indivisibly to his father and mother.
 Art. 322*
       No one may claim a status contrary to that which is given to him by his record of birth and an apparent status
 consistent with that record.
       And reciprocally, no one may contest the status of a person who has an apparent status consistent with his record
 of birth.
 Art. 322-1*
       If however it is alleged that there was a setting up of a supposititious child, or a substitution, even unintentional,
 either before, or after the drafting of the birth record, proof of it is admissible and may be made by any means.
 Art. 323*
       Failing record and apparent status, or where the child was entered, either under false names or without indication of
 the mother's name, proof of the parentage"may be judicially made only where there exist presumptions or circumstantial
 evidence serious enough to allow its being admissible." (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993).
       [repealed]
 Art. 324 *
       [repealed]
 Art. 325*
       Contrary proof may be made by any appropriate means to establish that the claimant is not the child of the mother
 whom he claims to have or even, maternity being proved, that it is not the child of the mother's husband.
       Where the husband was not joined in the case for the claiming of status, he may contest his paternity within a
 period of six months after the day when he knew of the judgment which entertained the petition of the child having
 become res judicata.
 Art. 326*
       Without waiting for a claim of status to be instituted by the child, the husband may, by any means, contest his
 paternity within a period of six months after the day when he knew of the birth.
 Art. 327*
       After the death of the husband, his heirs are likewise entitled to contest his paternity, either as a precautionary step
 where the husband was still in the prescribed period for doing so, or in defence to a claim of status.
 Art. 328*
       The spouses, separately or jointly, may, by bringing in proof as provided for in Article 323 above, claim a child as
 their own; but if the latter already has an established parentage, they must first demonstrate its inaccuracy, supposing
 that the case is one of those in which the law authorizes that demonstration.
                        SECTION III
                        Of Legitimation
 Art. 329*
 (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
 Articles 331* to 330*
       Legitimation may benefit all illegitimate children provided that their parentage has been lawfully established.
 Art. 330*
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 51/268
CIVIL CODE
 Articles 331* to 332-1*
       Legitimation takes place either by marriage of the parents, or on the authority of the court.
                                Paragraph 1
                                Of Legitimation by Marriage
 Art. 331*
       All children born out of wedlock,"even deceased" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993), are legitimated by operation of law
 by the subsequent marriage of their parents.
       Where their parentage was not already established, those children must be the subject of an acknowledgement at
 the moment of celebration of the marriage. In that event, the officer of civil status who performs the celebration shall take
 note of the acknowledgement and of the legitimation in a separate record.
 Art. 331-1*
       Where the parentage of an illegitimate child was established with regard to his father and mother or one of them
 only after their marriage, legitimation may take place only by virtue of a judgment.
       That judgment shall state that the child has, since the celebration of the marriage, enjoyed the apparent status of
 their common child.
 Art. 331-2*
       Any legitimation shall be mentioned in the margin of the record of birth of the legitimated child.
       That mention may be required by any party concerned. In the case of Article 331, the officer of civil status shall
 provide for it himself, where he had knowledge of the existence of the children.
       (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) The mention of the legitimation on the record of birth of an adult child is of no effect on
 his"family name" (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002) where the record does not contain in addition mention of the
 consent of the party concerned to the modification of his"family name" (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002).
 Art. 332 *
       [repealed]
 Art. 332-1*
       Legitimation confers on a legitimated child the rights and duties of a legitimate child. 
       By means of a joint declaration produced at the time of the celebration of the marriage or ascertained by the court,
 the parents are entitled to the option provided for in Article 311-21, if parentage has been established in the way
 provided for in Article 334-1 and if they did not avail themselves of the power given by Article 334-2 (Act no 2002-304 of
 4 March 2002; Act no 2003-516 of 18 June 2003)."Legitimation however may not have the effect of modifying the"family
 name" (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002; Act no 2003-516 of 18 June 2003) of an adult child without his consent" (Act
 no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993).
       It takes effect from the date of the marriage.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of Legitimation on the Authority of the Court
 Art. 333*
 Articles 333* to 333-6*
       Where it appears that a marriage is impossible between the two parents, the benefit of legitimation may yet be
 conferred on the child on the authority of the court provided that he has, with regard to the parent who so requests, the
 apparent status of an illegitimate child.
 Art. 333-1*
       A petition for purposes of legitimation must be initiated by one of the two parents or by both jointly before the 
tribunal de grande instance.
 Art. 333-2*
       Where one of the parents was, at the time of conception, in bonds of a wedlock which is not dissolved, his or her
 petition is admissible only with the consent of her or his spouse.
 Art. 333-3*
       The court shall verify whether the statutory conditions are fulfilled and, after receiving or inducing, if there is
 occasion, the comments of the child himself, of the other parent where he or she is not a party to the petition, as well as
 that of the spouse of the petitioner, it shall pronounce the legitimation, if it considers it is justified.
 Art. 333-4*
       A legitimation on the authority of the court takes effect at the date of the judgment which pronounces it finally.
       Where it took place on petition of one of the parents, it does not have any effect with regard to the other; it does not
 involve change of the"family" (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002) name of the child, unless the court otherwise decides. 
Art. 333-5*
       Where legitimation on the authority of the court was pronounced with regard to both parents,"the family name of the
 child is determined under the rules laid down by Articles 311-21 and 311-23" (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002); where
 he is a minor" the court shall rule on the terms of exercise of parental authority" (Act no 87-750 of 22 July 1987) as in
 matters of divorce.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 333-6*
       The provisions of Article 331-2 and of the first two paragraphs of Article 332-1 shall apply to legitimation on the
 authority of the court (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002).

 Art. 334-1*
 Articles 334* to 342-8*
 Articles 334* to 334-10*
       An illegitimate child acquires the name of the parent with regard to whom his parentage has been established in the
 first place. [repealed]
 Art. 334-2*
       "Where the name of an illegitimate child was not transmitted in the way provided for in Article 311-21, his parents
 may, by means of a joint declaration made before the officer of civil status, choose during his minority whether they will
 substitute to it the family name of the parent with regard to whom parentage was established in the second place, or
 couple their two names, in the order they choose, within the limit of one family name for each of them. Mention of the
 change of name shall appear in the margin of the record of birth." (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002; Act no 2003-516 of
 18 June 2003).
       Where the child is over"thirteen" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) years old, his personal consent is required.
 Art. 334-3*
       (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) "In the other cases, the change of name of an illegitimate child must be requested to
 the family causes judge. However, the tribunal de grande instance seized of a request for the change of status of an
 illegitimate child may in one and the same judgment rule on it and on the application for the change of name of the child
 that was brought before it".
       An action may be instituted during the minority of the child and within two years following either its coming of age, or
 a modification brought about in his status.
 Art. 334-4*
       The substitution of name extends as of right to the minor children of the party concerned. It extends to adult children
 only with their consent.
 Art. 334-5*
       "Failing established maternity or paternity, the father's wife or the mother's husband according to the circumstances
 may confer by substitution her or his family name to the child by a declaration made jointly with the other spouse,
 subject to the conditions set out in Article 334-2. Subject to the same conditions, the coupled names of both spouses
 may also be conferred on the child in the order they have chosen and within the limit of one name for each of them" ( Act
 no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002).
       The child may however request to take back the name which he bore before, through a petition submitted to
 the"family causes judge" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993), within two years following his coming of age.
 Art. 334-6*
       The rules for attributing a name provided for in the preceding Articles shall not prejudice the effects of an apparent
 status.
 Art. 334-7 *
       [repealed]
 Art. 334-8*
 (Act no 82-536 of 25 June 1982)
       Illegitimate parentage is lawfully established by voluntary acknowledgement.
       Illegitimate parentage may also be lawfully established by an apparent status or by the effect of a judgment.
 Art. 334-9*
       An acknowledgement is void, a paternity or maternity action is not admissible, where the child has a legitimate
 prentage already established by an apparent status.
 Art. 334-10*
       Where there exists between the father and mother of the illegitimate child one of the impediments to marriage
 provided for by Articles 161 and 162 above by reason of kinship, if parentage is already established with regard to the
 one, it is forbidden to establish parentage with regard to the other.

CIVIL CODE
                        Of the Acknowledgement of Illegitimate Children
 Articles 335* to 339*
 Art. 335*
 (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       Acknowledgment of an illegitimate child may be made in the record of birth, by an instrument received by the officer
 of civil status or by any other authentic instrument.
       The instrument shall contain the statements provided for in Article 62.
       (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) It shall also contain a mention that the maker of the acknowledgement was informed
 of the divisible character of the bond of illegitimate kinship.
 Art. 336*
       An acknowledgement of the father without indication of the mother and admission on her part, has effect only with
 regard to the father.
 Art. 337*
       A record of birth designating the mother is deemed to be an acknowledgment, where it is corroborated by an
 apparent status.
 Art. 338*
       So long as it is not contested in court, an acknowledgement renders inadmissible the establishing of another
 parentage which contradicts it.
 Art. 339*
       An acknowledgement may be contested by all persons having an interest therein, including his maker.
       An action may also be instituted by the Government procurator's office where circumstantial evidence based on the
 instruments themselves renders improbable the declared paternity or maternity."It may likewise be instituted where
 acknowledgement was made for evading the rules which govern adoption" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996).
       Where there exists an apparent status which is consistent with the acknowledgement and has lasted at least ten
 years after it, no contestation is any longer admissible, unless on the part of the other parent, of the child himself or of
 those who claim to be the true parents.

 Art. 340-1*
       [repealed]
 Art. 340-2*
       The action belongs only to the child.
       During the minority of the child, the mother, albeit a minor, is alone entitled to institute it.
       Where the mother did not acknowledge the child, where she is dead or unable to express her intention, the action
 shall be instituted as provided for in Article 464, paragraph 3, of this Code.
 Art. 340-3*
 (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       An action to establish paternity must be brought against the  alleged father or against his heirs; in the absence of
 heirs or where they have renounced the succession, against the State, the renouncing heirs being nevertheless joined in
 the action in order to maintain their rights.
 Art. 340-4*
       An action must be instituted within two years after the child's birth, on pain of lapse.
       (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) Where however the alleged father and the mother have lived, during the statutory
 period of conception, in a state of concubinage involving, in the absence of community life, an enduring or continuous
 relationship, the action may be instituted until the expiry of a period of two years following the ending of the
 concubinage. Where the alleged father contributed to the support, the education or the settling of the child in the
 capacity of a father, the action may be instituted until the expiry of a period of two years following the ending of that
 contribution.
       Where an action was not instituted during the minority of the child, the latter may institute it during two years after
 his coming of age.
 Art. 340-5*
       Where it entertains the action, the court may, on petition of the mother, order the father to reimburse her for all or
 part of her maternity and support expenses during the three months preceding and the three months following the birth,
 without prejudice to damages she may claim under Articles 1382 and 1383.
 Art. 340-6*

 Art. 340-7*
       When dismissing the petition, the judges may, however, allow subsidies to the child, if the relationship between the
 mother and the defendant was proved in the way provided for in Articles 342 and following.
 Art. 341*
 (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       Maternity suits are allowed subject to Article 341-1.
       The child who brings the action must prove that he is the one to whom the alleged mother has given birth.
       (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) Proof of it may be made only where there exist serious presumptions or circumstantial
 evidence.

                        Of the Action for Purpose of Subsidies
 Art. 342*
 Articles 342* to 342-8*
       An illegitimate child whose paternal parentage is not lawfully established may claim subsidies to the one who had a
 relationship with his mother during the statutory period of conception.
       (Act no 77-1456 of 29 Dec. 1977) An action may be instituted during the whole minority of the child; the latter may
 still institute it within two years following his coming of age where it was not done during his minority.
       An action is admissible even where the father or mother were, at the time of the conception, in the bonds of a
 wedlock with another person, or if there existed between them an impediment to marriage governed by Articles 161 to
 164 of this Code.
 Art. 342-1*
       An action for purpose of subsidies may also be instituted by the child of a married woman, where his record of
 legitimate child is not corroborated by an apparent status.
       Art.342-2
       Subsidies shall be settled, in the form of periodical payments, according to the needs of the child, the means of the
 debtor and his family situation.
       Periodical payments may be owed beyond the coming of age of the child, where he is still in need, unless that
 circumstance is imputable to his fault.
 Art. 342-3*
       Where there is occasion to apply Article 311-11 above, the judge, failing other factors for decision, has the
 discretion to impose on the defendants an indemnity intended to ensure the support and education of the child, where
 faults are established against them or commitments were previously entered into by them.  
       That indemnity shall be collected by the Children's aid service, a public-interest organization or a judicial agent
 bound to professional secrecy, who will pay it over to the statutory representative of the child. The terms of this
 collecting and of this paying over shall be fixed by decree.
       The provisions governing subsidies shall apply to that indemnity as to other issues.
 Art. 342-4*
 (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       A defendant may defeat a claim by proving by any means that he cannot be the father of the child.
 Art. 342-5*
       The responsibility of subsidies shall be transmitted to the succession of the debtor under the rules of Article"767"
 (Act no 2001-1135 of 3 Dec. 2001).
 Art. 342-6*
       Articles 340-2, 340-3 and 340-5 above shall apply to an action for purpose of subsidies.
 Art. 342-7*
       A judgment which awards subsidies creates between the debtor and the beneficiary, as well as, if there is occasion,
 between each of them and the parents or the spouse of the other, the impediments to marriage regulated by Articles 161
 to 164 of this Code.
 Art. 342-8*
       Res judicata on an action for purpose of subsidies gives rise to no bar to proceedings against a subsequent
 paternity suit.
       The award of subsidies ceases to have effect where the paternal parentage of the child happens to be established
 subsequently with regard to someone else than the debtor.

 Article 310-2
       Where there exists between the father and mother of the child one of the prohibitions to marriage due to lineage laid
 down by Articles 161 and 162, if parentage is already established with respect to one of them, it is prohibited to establish
 parentage with respect to the other by any means whatever.

                        Of Proofs and Presumptions
 Article 311
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
 Articles 311 to 311-3 to
 311-13
       Legislation presumes that a child was conceived during the period that extends from the three-hundredth to the
 one-hundred and eightieth day, inclusive, before the date of birth.
       Conception is presumed to have taken place at any time during that period, depending of what the welfare of the
 child requires.
       Contrary evidence may be adduced to rebut those presumptions.
 Article 311-1
       Apparent status shall result from a sufficient collection of facts showing a bond of parentage and relationship
 between a person and the family to which he is said to belong.
       The main ones of those facts shall be:
       1° That the person has been treated by the one or ones from whom he is said to descend as their child, and that he
 has treated them as his parent or parents;
       2° That they have, in that capacity, provided for his education, support or settling;
       3° That the person is recognized  as their child in society and by the family;
       4° That public authorities consider him as such;
       5° That he bears the name of those from whom he is said to descend.
 Article 311-2
       Apparent status must be continuous, peaceful, public and unequivocal.
 Article 310-3
       Parentage is proved by the record of birth of the child, by the instrument of acknowledgement or by the act of

       However, where a child and his father and mother or any one of them have their usual common or separate

 other elements of the parentage may depend upon a foreign law.

       [repealed]
 Article 311-17
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       A voluntary acknowledgement of paternity or maternity is valid where it was made in accordance with either the
 personal law of his or her doer, or the child's personal law.
 Article 311-18
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       A claim for purposes of subsidies is governed, at the choice of the child, by the law of its usual residence or the law
 of the usual residence of the debtor.
                        SECTION III
                        Of Medical Assistance to Procreation
 Article 311-19
 (Act no 94-653 of 29 July 1994)
 Articles 311-19 to
 311-20
       In case of a medically assisted procreation with a third party donor, no parental bonds may be established between
 the donor and the child born of the procreation.
       No claim  in tort may lie against a donor.
 Article 311-20
 (Act no 94-653 of 29 July 1994)
       Spouses or unmarried partners who, in order to procreate, resort to a medical assistance requiring the intervention
 of a third party donor, must, subject to conditions that ensure secrecy, give first their consents to a judge or a notaire
 who shall inform them of the consequences of their act as regards parentage.
       Consent given to a medically assisted procreation prohibits any action "for claiming or challenging parentage" (Ord.
 no 2005-759 of 4 July 2005) unless it is argued that the child was not born of the medically assisted procreation or that
 the consent was deprived of effect.
       Consent is deprived of effect in case of death, of the filing of a petition for divorce or judicial separation or of
 discontinuance of community life, occurred before the carrying out of the medically assisted procreation. It is also
 deprived of effect where the male or the female revokes it in writing and before the carrying out of the medically assisted
 procreation, in the hands of the physician in charge of the implementation of that assistance.
       He who, after consenting to medical assistance to procreation, does not acknowledge the child born of it renders
 himself liable vis-à-vis the mother and child
       (Ord. no 2005-759 of 4 July 2005) Furthermore, his paternity is judicially declared. The action shall comply with the
 provisions of Articles 328 and 331.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of the Rules of Devolution of Family Name
 Article 311-21
 (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002; Act no 2003-516 of 18 June 2003)
 Articles 311-21 to
 311-24
       Where the parentage of a child has been established with respect to his two parents at the latest on the day of
 declaration of his birth or afterwards but simultaneously, the parents shall choose the family name which devolves upon
 him: either the father's name, or the mother's name, or both names coupled in the order they choose within the limit of
 one family name for each of them. Failing a joint declaration to the officer of civil status mentioning the name chosen for
 the child, the latter shall take the name of the parent with respect to whom his parentage has first been established and
 the father's name where his parentage has been established simultaneously with respect to both.
       When a child one parent of whom at least is French is born abroad, parents who have not availed themselves of the
 power to choose the name in the way provided for in the preceding paragraph may make such a declaration at the time
 of the registration of the record, at the latest within three years of the child's birth.
       (Ord. no 2005-759 of 4 July 2005) Where this Article or Article 311-23, paragraph 2, have been applied to a
 common child, the name previously devolved or chosen goes for the other common children.
       Where the parents or one of them bear a double family name, they may, by a joint written declaration, transmit only
 one name to their children.
 Article 311-22
 (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002; Act no 2003-516 of 18 June 2003)
       The provisions of Article 311-21 shall apply to the child who becomes French in compliance with Article 22-1, in the
 way provided for by a decree  in Conseil d'Etat.
 Article 311-23
       Where parentage is established only with respect to one parent on the date of the declaration of birth, the child shall
 take that parent's name.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 57/268
CIVIL CODE
       When establishing the second bond of parentage and during the minority of the child, the parents may, by a joint
 declaration before the officer of civil status, choose either to substitute to him the family name of the parent with respect
 to whom parentage has been established in the second place, either to couple their two names, in the order they
 choose, within the limit of one family name for each of them. The change of name shall be mentioned in the margin of
 the record of birth.
       However, when Article 311-21 or the second paragraph of this Article has already been applied with respect to
 another common child, the declaration of change of name may have no other effect than giving the name previously
 devolved or chosen.
       If the child is over thirteen years of age, his personal consent is required.
 Article 311-24
       The power to choose provided for in Articles 311-21 and 311-23 may be exercised only once.

 Articles 311-25 to 315
 Article 311-25

                                Paragraph 2
                                Of the Presumption of Paternity
 Article 312
       A child conceived or born in wedlock has the husband as his father.
 Article 313
 Articles 312 to 315
       In case of petition for divorce or for judicial separation, the presumption of paternity shall not apply to a child born
 more than three hundred days after the date of  either the approval of the agreement which regulates the whole
 consequences of the divorce or of the provisional measures taken under Article 250-2, or of the ordonnance de
 non-conciliation, and  less than one hundred and eighty days following either the final dismissal of the petition or a
 reconciliation.
       The presumption of paternity regains however its full force, as of right, where the child has the apparent status of a
 legitimate child with regard to each spouses and where paternity is not established with respect to a third person.
 Article 314
       The presumption of paternity shall be set aside where the record of birth of the child does not indicate the husband
 as the father and the child has no apparent status with respect to him..
 Article 315
       Where  the presumption of paternity is set aside in the circumstances provided for in Articles 313 and 314, its
 effects may be reinstated in court in the way provided for in Article 329.

                        Of the Establishment of Parentage by Acknowledgement
 Article 316
 Article 316
       Where parentage is not established in the way provided for in Section I of this Chapter, it may be so by an
 acknowledgement of paternity or maternity, made before or after the birth.
       An acknowledgement establishes parentage only with respect to his or her author.
       It may be made in the record of birth, by instrument received by the officer of civil status or by any other authentic
 instrument.
       The instrument shall contain the statements set out in Article 62 and the mention that the author of the
 acknowledgement has been informed of the divisible character of the parental bond so established.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Establishment of Parentage by Apparent Status
 Article 317
 Article 317
       Each parent or the child may request the judge to issue, in the way provided for in Articles 71 and 72, an affidavit
 which will be proof of the apparent status until evidence contrary to it.
       Where the alleged parent is deceased before the declaration of birth of the child, the affidavit may be issued if a
 sufficient collection of facts within the meaning of Article 311-1 is proved.
       The issue of an affidavit may be requested only within a period of five years as from the ending of the alleged
 apparent status.

       As long as it has not been contested in court, a lawfully established parentage is a bar to establishing another
 parentage which would contradict it.
 Article 321
       Whenever they are not confined by statute within another period, claims regarding parentage are time-barred after
 ten years as from the day when the person was deprived of the status that he claims, or began to enjoy the status that is

 as from the birth or the acknowledgement, if the latter was made later on.

 Article 342
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
 Articles 342 to 342-8
       A [...] child whose paternal parentage is not lawfully established may claim subsidies to him who had intercourse
 with his mother during the statutory period of conception.
       (Act no 77-1456 of 29 Dec. 1977) A claim may be instituted during the whole minority of the child; the latter may still
 institute it within two years following his coming of age where it was not done during his minority.
       A claim is admissible even where the father or mother were, at the time of the conception, in the bonds of a wedlock
 with another person, or if there existed between them an impediment to marriage governed by Articles 161 to 164 of this

 subsidies.
 Article 342-7
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       A judgment which awards subsidies creates between the debtor and the beneficiary, as well as, if there is occasion,
 between each of them and the parents or the spouse of the other, the impediments to marriage regulated by Articles 161
 to 164 of this Code.
 Article 342-8

        TITLE VIII
        OF ADOPTION
                CHAPTER I
                Of Plenary Adoption
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Requisites for Plenary Adoption
 Art. 343
 (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996)
 Articles 343 to 370-5
 Articles 343 to 359
 Articles 343 to 350
       Adoption may be petitioned by two spouses not judicially separated , married for more than two years or who are
 both older than twenty-eight years.
 Art. 343-1
       Adoption may be also petitioned by a person over"twenty-eight years of age" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996).
       Where the adopter is married and not judicially separated, his or her spouse's consent is required unless this
 spouse is unable to express his or her intention.
 Art. 343-2
 (Act no 76-1179 of 22 Dec. 1976)
       The requirement as to age provided for in the preceding Article is not imposed in the case of adoption of the
 spouse's child.
 Art. 344
       The adopters must be fifteen years older than the children whom they propose to adopt. Where the latter are their
 spouse's children the required difference of age is only ten years.
       (Act no 76-1179 of 22 Dec. 1976) The court may, however, if there are good reasons, make an adoption order
 where the difference in ages is smaller than that provided for by the preceding paragraph.
 Art. 345
       Adoption is allowed only in favour of children under fifteen, who have been received in the home of the adopter or
 adopters for at least six months.
       Where however the child is older than fifteen and has been received before having reached that age by persons
 who did not fulfil the statutory requirements for adopting or where he was the subject of an ordinary adoption before
 reaching that age, plenary adoption may be applied for if the conditions for it are fulfilled,"during the minority of the child
 and within two years following his coming of age" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996).
       Where it is older than"thirteen" (Act no 76-1179 of 22 Dec. 1976), an adopted must personaly consent to his plenary
 adoption.
 Art. 345-1
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 61/268
CIVIL CODE
 (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996)
       Plenary adoption of the spouse's child is allowed:
       1° Where the child has a lawfully established parentage only with regard to that spouse;
       2° Where the parent other than the spouse has been totally deprived of parental authority;
       3° Where the parent other than the spouse is dead and has left no ascendant of the first degree or where the latter
 obviously took no further interest in the child.
 Art. 346
       No one may be adopted by several persons unless by two spouses.
       (Act no 76-1179 of 22 Dec. 1976) However, a new adoption may be ordered either after the death of the adopter or
 the two adopters, or after the death of one of the two adopters if the request is made by the new spouse of the survivor.
 Art. 347
       May be adopted:
       1° Children to the adoption of whom the father and mother or the family council have validly consented;
       2° Wards of the State;
       3° Children declared abandoned in the way provided for in Article 350.
 Art. 348
       Where the parentage of a child is established with regard to his father and mother, the latter must both consent to
 the adoption.
       Where one of them is dead or unable to express his or her consent or has lost his or her rights of parental authority,
 the consent of the other suffices.
 Art. 348-1
       Where the parentage of a child is established only with regard to one of his parents, that one shall give the consent
 to adoption.
 Art. 348-2
       Where the father and mother of the child are dead, unable to express their intention or deprived of their rights of
 parental authority, consent shall be given by the family council, after advice of the person who actually takes care of the
 child.
       It shall be likewise where the parentage of the child is not established.
 Art. 248-3
       Consent to the adoption shall be given"before the clerk in chief" (Act no 95-424 of 8 Feb. 1995) of the tribunal
 d'instance of the domicile or residence of the person who consents, or before a French or foreign notaire, or before
 French diplomatic or consular agents. It may also be received by the Children's aid service where the child was
 entrusted to them.
       Consent to adoption may be withdrawn within"two months" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996). Withdrawal must be
 made by registered letter with request for advice of delivery addressed to the person or service that received the
 consent to adoption. The handing over of the child to his parents on even verbal request shall also be treated as proof of
 the withdrawal.
       Where, on the expiry of the period of"two months" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996), consent was not withdrawn, the
 parents may still request restitution of the child, provided that he has not been placed for purpose of adoption. Where
 the person who received him refuses to give him back, the parents may refer the matter to the court which, taking into
 account the welfare of the child, shall determine whether there is occasion to order his restitution. By effect of restitution,
 a consent to adoption lapses.
 Art. 348-4
 (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996)
       Where the father and mother or the family council consent to the adoption of a child by entrusting him to the
 Children's aid service or to a body authorized for adoption, the choice of the adopter is left to the guardian with the
 agreement of the family council of the wards of the State or of the family council of the guardianship organized on the
 initiative of the body authorized for adoption.
 Art. 348-5
       Except where there exists a bond of relationship by blood or by marriage up to the sixth degree inclusive between
 the adopter and the adoptee, the consent to adoption of children under two years old is valid only if the child was
 actually entrusted to the Children's aid service"or to a body authorized for adoption" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996).
 Art. 348-6
       The court may make an adoption order where it considers abusive the refusal of consent raised by the [...] parents
 or by one of them only, when they took no further interest in the child at the risk of endangering his health or morality.
       It shall be likewise in case of abusive refusal of consent by the family council.
 Art. 349
       As regards the wards of State whose parents did not consent to an adoption, consent shall be given by the family

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 350
 (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996)
       A child received by a private person, a body or a Children's aid service, whose parents obviously took no further
 interest to him during the year preceding the institution of a petition for declaration of abandonment, shall be declared
 abandoned by the tribunal de grande instance, [...] and without prejudice to the provisions of paragraph 4. A petition for
 declaration of abandonment is required to be transmitted by the private person, the body or the Children's aid service
 who have received the child on the expiry of a period of one year where the parents obviously took no further interest to
 it.
       (Act no 76-1179 of 22 Dec. 1976) Are deemed to have obviously taken no further interest to their child parents who
 have not entertained with him relations necessary to maintain bonds of affection.
       A mere withdrawal of consent to adoption, a request for news or a wish expressed but not carried out to take the
 child back may not be a token of interest sufficient to constitute the ground of a dismissal as of right of a petition for
 declaration of abandonment."Those steps may not interrupt the period set out in paragraph 1"(Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan.
 1993).
       Abandonment may not be declared where, during the period set out in paragraph 1 of this Article, a member of the
 family petitioned to assume care of the child and where that petition is declared to be consonant with the welfare of the
 child.
       Where it declares that the child is abandoned, the court shall, by the same order, delegate the rights of parental
 authority over the child to the Children's aid service, to the body or to the private person"who received the child or to
 whom the latter was entrusted" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993).
       A third party application for revocation of the order is admissible only in case of deception, fraud or mistake as to the
 identity of the child.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Placing for Purpose of Plenary Adoption and of the Judgment of Plenary
 Adoption
 Art. 351
 Articles 351 to 354
       Placing for the purpose of adoption must be made by actual entrusting to the prospective adopters of a child for
 whom a valid and final consent to adoption was given, of a ward of State or of a child declared abandoned by judicial
 decision.
       Where the parentage of the child is not established, there may be no placing for purpose of adoption during a period
 of"two months" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) after the receiving of the child.
       Placing may not take place where the parents of the child have petitioned for the restitution of the child so long as
 there is no decision on the conclusiveness of that petition at the request of the most diligent party.
 Art. 352
       Placing for the purpose of adoption is a bar to a restitution of the child to his family of origin. It defeats any
 declaration of parentage and any acknowledgement.
       Where a placing for the purpose of adoption comes to an end or where the court refuses to order adoption, the
 effects of placing are retroactively set aside.
 Art. 353
       An adoption order may be made at the request of the adopter by the tribunal de grande instance which shall
 verify"within six months after reference to the court" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993), whether the statutory requirements
 are fulfilled and adoption is consonant with the welfare of the child.
       (Act no 76-1179 of 22 Dec. 1976) In case the adopter has descendants, the court shall verify in addition whether the
 adoption is not likely to imperil family life.
       Where the adopter dies after having properly received the child for purpose of his adoption, a petition may be filed
 on his or her behalf by the surviving spouse or by one of the adopter's heirs.
       (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) Where the child dies after being properly received for purpose of its adoption, the
 petition may nevertheless be filed. The judgment has effect on the day preceding the death and involves only
 modification of the civil status of the child.
       An adoption order shall not state its reasons.
 Art. 353-1
 (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996)
       In case of adoption of a ward of State", of a child entrusted to a body authorized for adoption" (Act no 2002-93 of 22
 Jan. 2002), or of an alien child who is not the child of the adopter's spouse, the court shall verify before making an
 adoption order that the petitioner or petitioners gained an authorization to adopt or were dispensed with it.
       Where an authorization was refused or was not issued within the statutory period, the court may make an adoption
 order if it considers that the petitioners have the capacity to receive the child and that the adoption is consonant with his
 welfare.
 Art. 353-2
       A third party application for revocation of the adoption order is admissible only in case of  deception or fraud
 imputable to the adopters.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 354
       Within fifteen days of the date on which it came into force of res judicata, an order pronouncing plenary adoption
 shall be registered on the registers of civil status of the place of birth of the adoptee, on request of the Government
 procurator.
       (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) Where the adoptee was born in a foreign country, the order shall be registered on
 the registers of the central service of civil status of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
       The registration shall state the day, hour and place of birth, the sex of the child as well as his"family name and" (Act
 no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002) first names such as they result from the adoption order, the first names, names, date and
 place of birth, occupation and domicile of the adopter or adopters. It may not contain any indication as to the actual
 parentage of the child.
       The registration takes the place of a record of birth for the adoptee.
       "The original record of birth kept by a French officer of civil status and, where appropriate," (Act no 96-604 of 5 July
 1996) the record of birth established under Article 58 shall, on the initiative of the Government procurator, be
 stamped"adoption" and treated as void.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Effects of Plenary Adoption
 Art. 355
       Adoption produces its effects from the day of the filing of the petition for adoption.
 Art. 356
 Articles 355 to 359
       Adoption confers on the child a parentage which substitutes for his original parentage: the adoptee ceases to
 belong to his blood family, subject to the prohibitions of marriage referred to in Articles 161 to 164.
       (Act no 76-1179 of 22 Dec. 1976) However, an adoption of the spouse's child still leaves extant his original
 parentage with regard to that spouse and his or her family. It produces, furthermore, the effects of an adoption by two
 spouses.
 Art. 357
       Adoption confers on the child the name of the adopter.
       "In case of adoption by two spouses, the name conferred on a child is determined under the rules laid down in
 Article 311-21" (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002).
       On request of the adopter or adopters, the court may modify the first names of the child. 
       "Where the adopter is a married woman or a married man, the court may, in the adoption order, decide, on request
 of the adopter, that the name of the spouse will be conferred on the adoptee, subject to the consent of the spouse. The
 court may also, on request of the adopter and subject to the consent of the spouse, confer on the child the coupled
 names of the spouses in the order they choose and within the limit of one family name for each of them.
       "Where the husband or the wife of the adopter is dead or unable to express his or her intention, the court shall in its
 discretion make a determination after consulting the heirs of the deceased or the closest persons entitled to inherit from
 him or her."(Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002)
 Art. 357-1
 (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002)
       The provisions of Article 311-21 shall apply to a child who was the subject of an adoption lawfully ordered abroad
 and having in France the effects of a plenary adoption.
       The adopters shall exercise the option available under that Article at the time of the request for registration of an
 adoption order by declaration sent to the Government procurator of the place where that registration is to be made. 
       Where the adopters request an order for enforcement of a foreign adoption order, they shall join a declaration of
 option to their request. Mention of that declaration shall be made in the decision.
       Mention of the name chosen shall be made at the suit of the Government procurator, in the child's record of birth.
 Art. 358
       An adoptee has, in the family of the adopter, the same rights and obligations as a child"whose parentage is
 established under Title VII of this Book" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002).
 Art. 359
       Adoption is irrevocable.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Ordinary Adoption
                        SECTION I
                        Of Requisites and Judgment
 Art. 360
       Ordinary adoption is allowed irrespective of the age of the adoptee.
 Articles 360 to 369
 Articles 360 to 362
       (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) Where there are serious reasons justifying it, an ordinary adoption of a child who was
 the subject of a plenary adoption is allowed.
       Where the adoptee is over"thirteen" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993), he must personally consent to the adoption.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 361
       (Act no 76-1179 of 22 Dec. 1976).- The provisions of Articles 343 to 344, 346 to 350, 353, 353-1, 353-2, 355, and"
 of the last two paragraphs or Article 357" (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002), shall apply to ordinary adoption.
 Art. 362
       Within fifteen days of the date on which it becomes res judicata, the order that pronounces an ordinary adoption
 must be mentioned or registered on the registers of civil status on request of the Government procurator.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Effects of Ordinary Adoption
 Art. 363
 Articles 363 to 369
       (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993).- Ordinary adoption confers the name of the adopter on the adoptee by adding it to
 the name of the latter. 
       "Where the adoptee and the adopter, or one of them, bear a double family name, the name conferred on the
 adoptee results from the addition of the adopter's name to his own name, within the limit of one name for each of them.
 The choice belongs to the adopter, who must obtain the consent of the adoptee where the latter is older than thirteen. In
 case of disagreement or failing a choice, the name conferred on the adoptee results from the adjunction of the first of the
 adopter to the first name of the adoptee.
       "In case of an adoption by two spouses, the name coupled with that of the adoptee shall be, on request of the
 adopters, either that of the husband, or that of the wife, within the limit of one  name for each of them, and, failing an
 agreement, the first of the husband's names. Where the adoptee bears a double family name, the choice of the name
 which is preserved belongs to the adopters, who must obtain the consent of the adoptee where he is older than thirteen.
 In case of disagreement or failing a choice, the name conferred on the adoptee results from the adjunction of the
 adopter's first name to the adoptee's first name.
       The court, however, may at the request of the adopter, decide that the adoptee will bear only the name of the
 adopter."In case of an adoption by two spouses, the family name substituted to that of the adoptee may, at the choice of
 the adopters, be either that of the husband, or that of the wife, or the coupled names of the spouses in the order they
 choose and within the limit of one name for each of them" (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002). That request may also be
 filed after the adoption. Where the adoptee is older than thirteen, his personal consent to that substitution of a"family
 name" (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002) is required.
 Art. 363-1
 (Act no 2002-304 of 4 March 2002)
       The provisions of Article 363 shall apply to a child who has been the subject of an adoption lawfully ordered abroad
 and which has in France the effects of an ordinary adoption, where the record of birth is kept by a French authority.
       The adopters must exercise the option available under that Article by a declaration sent to the Government
 procurator of the place where the record of birth is kept on the occasion of a request for updating the latter.
       Mention of the name chosen is entered on the record of birth of the child, at the suit of the Government procurator.
 Art. 364
       An adoptee remains in his family of origin and preserves all his rights therein, in particular his rights of succession.
       The prohibitions to marriage provided for in Articles 161 to 164 of this Code apply between the adoptee and his
 family of origin.
 Art. 365
       An adopter is, with regard to the adoptee, alone invested of all the rights of parental authority, including that of
 consenting to the marriage of the adoptee, unless she or he is the spouse of the father or of the mother of the adoptee;
 in that event, the adopter has parental authority concurrently with his or her spouse,"who retains alone the exercise of it,
 subject to a joint declaration with the adopter before the chief clerk of the tribunal de grande instance for the purpose of
 an exercise in common of that authority" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002).
       The rights of parental authority are exercised  by the adopter or adopters on the"terms provided for by Chapter I of
 Title IX of this Book" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002).
       The rules of statutory administration and of guardianship of"minors" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002) shall apply
 to an adoptee.
 Art. 366
       The bond of kinship resulting from adoption extend to the [repealed] children of the adoptee.
       Marriage is prohibited :
       1° Between the adopter, the adoptee and his descendants;
       2° Between the adoptee and the adopter's spouse; reciprocally, between the adopter and the adoptee's spouse;
       3° Between the adoptee children of the same individual;
       4° Between the adoptee and the adopter's children.
       Nevertheless, the prohibitions to marriage provided for in 3° and 4° above may be lifted by dispensation of the
 President of the Republic, where there are serious reasons.
       (Act no 76-1179 of 22 Dec. 1976) The prohibition to marriage provided for in 2° above may be lifted in the same
 conditions where the person who created the kinship is deceased.
 Art. 367
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 65/268
CIVIL CODE
       An adoptee owes maintenance to the adopter where he is in need and, reciprocally, an adopter owes maintenance
 to the adoptee.
       The obligation of maintenance continues to exist between the adoptee and his father and mother. However, the
 father and mother of the adoptee are bound to provide maintenance to him only where he cannot obtain it from the
 adopter.
 Art. 368
 (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002)
       An adoptee and his descendants have, in the family of the adopter, the rights to succession provided for in Book III,
 Title I, Chapter III.
       (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) The adoptee and his descendants do not have, however, the status of compulsory
 heirs with regard to the ascendants of the adopter.
 Art. 368-1
       Where an adoptee dies without descendants, property given by the adopter or received through succession from
 him shall return to the adopter or his descendants, where it still exists in kind at the time of the death of the adoptee, on
 condition to contribute to debts and subject to the vested rights of third parties. Property received gratuitously by the
 adoptee from his father and mother shall return likewise to the latter or to their descendants.
       The surplus of property of an adoptee shall be divided in halves between the family of origin and the adopter's
 family, without prejudice to the rights of the spouse on the whole of the succession.
 Art. 369
       The effects of an adoption continue notwithstanding the subsequent establishment of a parental bo,d.

 Ordered Abroad
 Art. 370
 (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996)
 Articles 370 to 370-5
       Where serious reasons so justify, adoption may be revoked , on request of the adopter or the adoptee, or, where
 the latter is a minor, of that of the Government procurator's office.
       A request for revocation made by the adopter is admissible only where the adoptee is over fifteen.
       Where the adoptee is a minor, the father and mother by blood or, failing them, a member of the family of origin up to
 the degree of cousin-german may also request revocation.
 Art. 370-1
       An order which revokes an adoption shall state its reasons
       Its operative part shall be mentioned in the margin of the record of birth or of the registration of the adoption order,
 in the way provided for in Article 362.
 Art. 370-2
       Revocation causes all effects of adoption to cease for the future.
 Art. 370-3
       The requirements for adoption are governed by the national law of the adopter or, in case of adoption by two
 spouses, by the law which governs the effects of their union. Adoption however may not be ordered where it is
 prohibited by the national laws of both spouses.
       Adoption of a foreign minor may not be ordered where his personal law prohibits that institution, unless the minor
 was born and resides usually in France.
       Whatever the applicable law may be, adoption requires the consent of the statutory representative of the child.
 Consent must be free, obtained without any compensation, subsequent to the birth of the child and informed as to the
 consequences of adoption, specially where it is given for the purpose of a plenary adoption, as to the entire and
 irrevocable character of the breaking off of the pre-existing parental bond.
 Art. 370-4
       The effects of an adoption ordered in France are those of French law.
 Art. 370-5
       An adoption lawfully ordered in a foreign country produces in France the effects of a plenary adoption where it
 breaks off completely and irrevocably the pre-existing parental bond. Failing which, it produces the effects of an ordinary
 adoption. It may be converted into a plenary adoption where the required consents were given expressly and advisedly.

CIVIL CODE
       A child, at any age, owes honour and respect to his father and mother.
 Art. 371-1
 (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002)
       Parental authority is a set of rights and duties whose finality is the welfare of the child.
       It  is vested in  the father and mother until the majority or emancipation of the child in order to protect him in his
 security, health and morality, to ensure his education and allow his development, showing regard to his person. 
       Parents shall make a child a party to  judgments relating to him, according to his age and degree of maturity.
 Art. 371-2
 (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002)
       Each one of the parents shall contribute to the education and support of the children in proportion to his or her
 means, to those of the other parent and to the needs of the child.
       That obligation does not come to an end as of right where the child is of age.
 Art. 371-3
       A child may not, without the permission of the father and mother, leave the family home and he may be removed
 from it only in cases of necessity as determined by statute.
 Art. 371-4
 (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002)
       A child has the right to have personal relations with his grandparents. Only serious reasons may constitute a bar to
 that right.
       Where the welfare of the child so requires, the family causes judge shall fix the details of the relations between a
 child and a third person, relative or not.
 Art. 371-5
 (Act no 96-1238 of 30 Dec. 1996)
       A child may not be separated from its brothers and sisters, unless this is not possible or where his welfare dictates a
 different solution. If there is occasion, the  judge shall rule on the relations between the brothers and sisters.

                        Of the Exercise of Parental Authority

       The father and mother shall exercise in common parental authority.
 Articles 372 to 374-2
 Articles 372 to 372-1
 and Art. 372-1
       Where, however, parentage is established with regard to one of them more than one year after the birth of a child
 whose parentage is already established with regard to the other, the latter alone remains vested with the exercise of
 parental authority. It shall be likewise where parentage is judicially declared with regard to the second parent of the
 child.
       Parental authority may however be exercised in common in case of joint declaration of the father and mother before
 the chief clerk of the tribunal de grande instance or upon judgment
       of the family causes judge.

       Where one of the"parents" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) performs alone an usual act of parental authority
 concerning the person of the child, he or she shall be considered to be acting with the consent of the other with regard to
 third parties in good faith,.
 Art. 373
 (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002)
       Shall be deprived of the exercise of parental authority the father or mother who is unable to express his or her

 Articles 373-2 to
 373-2-5
       Separation of the parents has no influence on the rules of devolution of the exercise of parental authority.
       Each of the father and mother shall maintain personal relations with the child and respect the bonds of the latter
 with the other parent.
       Any change of residence of one of the parents, where it modifies the terms of exercise of parental authority, shall be
 the subject of a notice to the other parent, previously and in due time. In case of disagreement between them, the most
 diligent parent shall refer the matter to the family causes judge who shall rule according to what the welfare of the child
 requires. The judge shall apportion removal expenses and adapt accordingly the amount of the contribution to the
 support and education of the child.
 Art. 373-2-1
       Where the welfare of the child so requires, the judge may commit exercise of parental authority to one of the
 parents.
       The exercise of the right of access and lodging may be refused to the other parent only for serious reasons.
       That parent shall keep the right and duty to supervise the support and education of the child. He or she must have
 notice of the important choices relating to the life of the child. He or she shall comply with the obligation that devolves
 upon him or her under Article 371-2.
 Art. 373-2-2
       In case of a separation between the parents, or between the latter and the child, a contribution to his support and
 education shall take the form of periodical payments to be paid, according to the circumstances, by one of the parents to
 the other, or to the person to whom the child is entrusted.
       The terms and guaranties of those periodical payments shall be fixed by the approved agreement referred to in
 Article 373-2-7 or, failing which, by the judge.
       Those payments may in whole or in part take the form of a direct taking charge of costs incurred on behalf of a
 child.
       They may in whole or in part be effected under the form of a right of use and dwelling.
 Art. 373-2-3
       Where the consistence of the debtor's property so permits, periodical payments may be replaced, in whole or in
 part, under the terms and guarantees provided for by the approved agreement or by the judge, by the payment of a sum
 of money in the hands of an accredited body responsible for granting in counterpart to the child an index-linked annuity,
 a surrender of property in usufruct or an allocation of property yielding income.
 Art. 373-2-4
       Ascription of additional means, in particular under the form of periodical payments, may, if there is occasion, be
 requested later on.
 Art. 373-2-5
       A parent who has primarily the responsibility of an adult child who cannot meet his own needs may ask the other
 parent to pay a contribution to his support and education. The judge may decide or the parents agree that this
 contribution be paid in whole or in part into the hands of the child.

                                Of the Intervention of the Family Causes Judge
 Art. 373-2-6
 Articles 373-2-6 to
 373-2-13
       A judge of the tribunal de grande instance in charge of family causes shall settle issues brought before him in the
 framework of this Chapter in watching in particular over the safeguarding of the welfare of minor children.
       The judge may order measures that allow to protect continuity and effectiveness of the keeping of the bonds of the
 child with each of his parents.
       He may in particular order an entry on the passports of the parents to prohibit the child's departure from the territory
 without the authorization of the two parents.
 Art. 373-2-7
       Parents may seize the family causes judge to have approved the agreement through which they organize the terms
 of exercise of parental authority and establish their contributions to the support and education of the child.
       The judge shall approve the agreement unless he observes that it does not sufficiently protect the welfare of the
 child or that the consent of the parents was not freely given.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 373-2-8
       The judge may also be seized by one of the parents or the Government procurator, who may himself be seized by a
 third person, relative or not, for the purpose of ruling upon the terms of exercise  of parental authority and the
 contribution to the support and education of the child.
 Art. 373-2-9
       In compliance with the two preceding Articles, the residence of a child may be fixed alternately at the domicile of
 each of the parents or at the domicile of one of them.
       On request of one of the parents or in case of disagreement between them about the mode of residence of the
 child, the judge may order provisionally an alternate residence of which he shall determine the duration. On the expiry of
 it, the judge shall rule finally on the residence of the child alternately at the domicile of each of the parents or at the
 domicile of one of them.
 Art. 373-2-10
       In case of disagreement, the judge shall endeavour to conciliate the parties.
       For the purpose of making easier the search by the parents of a consensual exercise of parental authority, the judge
 may offer them a measure of mediation and, after gaining their agreement, designate a family mediator who will initiate
 it.
       He may call upon them to meet a family mediator who will acquaint them with the subject and progress of such a
 measure.
 Art. 373-2-11
       Where he rules on the terms of exercise of parental authority, the judge shall take into consideration in particular:
       1° The practice previously followed by the parents or the agreements they entered into earlier;
       2° Feelings expressed by a minor child in the way provided for in Article 388-1;
       3° The capacity of each parent to assume his or her duties and to respect the rights of the other;
       4° The result of court-ordered appraisals possibly carried out, taking into account in particular the age of the child;
       5° Information collected in possible social enquiries and counter-enquiries provided for in Article 373-2-12.
 Art. 373-2-12
       Before any decision fixing the terms of exercise of parental authority and of the right of access, or entrusting the
 children to a third person, the judge may assign the task of undertaking a social enquiry to any qualified person. This is
 for the purpose of collecting information on the situation of the family and on the conditions in which the children live and
 are educated.
       Where one of the parents contests the conclusions of a social inquiry, a counter-inquiry may be ordered on his or
 her request.
       A social inquiry may not be used in a trial of a cause for divorce.
 Art. 373-2-13
       The provisions of an approved agreement as well as the  judgments relating to the exercise of parental authority
 may be varied or completed at any time by the judge, on request of the parents or of a parent or of the Government
 procurator, who himself may be seized by a third person, relative or not.
                                Paragraph 4
                                Of the Intervention of Third Persons
 Art. 373-3
 (Act no 87-570 of 22 July 1987)
 Articles 373-3 to 374-2
       "Separation of the parents" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002) is not a bar to the devolution provided for by Article
 373-1, even where the parent who remains able to exercise parental authority was deprived of the exercise of some
 attributes of that authority by the effects of a judgment delivered against him or her.
       (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002) The judge may, by way of exception and where the welfare of the child so
 requires, in particular when one of the parents is deprived of the exercise or parental authority, decide to entrust the
 child to a third person, chosen preferably within his relatives. He shall be seized and shall rule under Articles 373-2-8
 and 373-2-11.
       In exceptional circumstances, the"family causes judge" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) who decides on the terms of
 exercise of parental authority after"a separation of the parents" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002) may decide, even in
 the lifetime of the parents, that in case of death of the parent who exercises parental authority, the child may not be
 placed in the custody of the survivor. He may, in that event, designate the person to whom the child shall temporarily be
 entrusted.
       [deleted]
 Art. 373-4
 (Act no 87-570 of 22 July 1987)
       Where the child was entrusted to a third party, parental authority shall continue to be exercised by the father and
 mother; however, the person to whom the child was entrusted shall perform all the usual acts regarding his supervision
 and education.
       The"family causes judge" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993), where he temporarily entrusts the child to a third person,
 may decide that the latter shall require the establishment of a guardianship.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 374
 (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       Where the parentage of an illegitimate child is established only with regard to one of his parents, the latter shall
 exercise parental authority alone.
       Where his parentage is established with regard to both parents under terms different from those provided for in
 Article 372, parental authority shall be exercised by the mother. It shall however be exercised in common by both
 parents where they make a joint declaration thereof before the"clerk in chief of the tribunal de grande instance" (Act no
 95-125 of 8 Feb. 1995).
       In all cases the family causes judge may, on request of the father, the mother or the Government procurator's office,
 modify the terms of exercise of parental authority with regard to an illegitimate child. He may decide that it will be
 exercised either by one of the two parents, or in common by both parents; in that case, he shall designate the parent at
 whose home the child will have his usual residence.
       The family causes judge may grant a right of supervision to the parent who does not have the exercise of parental
 authority. He may refuse him or her a right of access and lodging only for serious reasons.
       In case of exercise in common of parental authority, the parent at whose home the children do not usually reside
 shall contribute to their support and education in proportion to the respective means of the parents.
 Art. 374-1
 (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       The court which decides on the establishing of a [...] parentage may decide to entrust the child temporarily to a third
 person who will be in charge of requiring the organization of a guardianship.
 Art. 374-2
       In all cases provided for in this Title, a guardianship may be established even where there is no property to be
 administered.
       It shall be then organized in accordance with the provisions of Title X.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Educational Assistance
 Art. 375
 Articles 375 to 375-9
       Where the health, security or morality of a not emancipated minor are imperilled, or where the conditions of his
 education are seriously endangered, measures of educational assistance may be judicially ordered on request of the
 father and mother jointly, or of one of them,"of the person or body to whom the child was entrusted" (Act no 87-570 of 22
 July 1987) or of the guardian, of the minor himself or of the Government procurator's office. Exceptionally, the judge may
 be seized of his own motion.
       They may be ordered at the same time with regard to several children dependent on a same parental authority.
       (Act no 86-17 of 6 Jan. 1986) The decision shall fix the duration of the measure without exceeding two years, where
 it relates to an educational measure implemented by a service or body. A measure may be renewed by a judgment
 setting out the grounds on which it is based.
 Art. 375-1
       The juvenile judge shall have jurisdiction, subject to appeal, in all matters relating to educational assistance.
       He shall always endeavour to secure the adhesion of the family to the measure contemplated.
 Art. 375-2
       Whenever possible, a minor must be kept in his present circle. In that case, the judge shall designate, either a
 qualified person, or a service of observation, education or rehabilitation in the free community, with the mission of
 bringing aid and counsel to the family in order to overcome the material or moral difficulties which it is encountering.
 That person or service shall be responsible for following the development of the child and making a periodical report of it
 to the judge.
       The judge may also make the keeping of the child in his circle conditional on specific obligations, such as that of
 regularly attending a medical or educational institution, ordinary or specialized, or of exercising a professional activity.
 Art. 375-3
       Where it is necessary to withdraw the child from his present circle, the judge may decide to entrust him:
       1°"To the other parent" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002) ;
       2° To another member of the family or to a trustworthy third person;
       3° To a medical or educational, ordinary or specialized, service or institution;
       4°"To a départemental Children's aid service" (Act no 89-487 of 10 July 1989).
       However, where a petition for divorce was filed or a divorce order handed down between the father and mother,
 those measures may be taken only if a new circumstance likely to endanger the minor is revealed after the
 decision"which rules on the terms of exercise of parental authority or entrusts the child to a third person" (Act no 87-570
 of 22 July 1987) . They may not be a bar to the power of the"family causes judge" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) to
 decide,"under Article 373-3" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002), to whom the child is to be entrusted. The same rules
 shall apply to judicial separation.
 Art. 375-4
 (Act no 87-570 of 22 July 1987)
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 70/268
CIVIL CODE
       In the circumstances specified in 1°, 2° and 3° of the preceding Article, the judge may assign either to a qualified
 person, or to a service of observation, education or rehabilitation in the free community, the mission of bringing aid and
 counsel to the person or the service to whom the child was entrusted, as well as to the family, and of following the
 development of the child.
       In all cases, the judge may join the handing over of the child with the same terms as under Article 375-2, paragraph
 2. He may also decide that periodical report shall be made to him as to the situation of the child.
 Art. 375-5
       Provisionally, but subject to appeal, the judge may, pending suit, either order the provisory handing over of the child
 to a rest or observation centre, or take one of the measures provided for in Articles 375-3 and 375-4.
       In case of emergency, the Government procurator of the place where the child was found, shall have the same
 power, with the responsibility of referring the matter within eight days to the competent judge who shall maintain, vary or
 revoke the measure. 
Art. 375-6
       Decisions taken in matters of educational assistance may, at any time, be varied or revoked by the judge who took
 them, either of his own motion, or on request of the father and mother jointly or of one of them,"of the person or service
 to whom the child was entrusted" (Act no 87-570 of 22 July 1987) or of the guardian, the child himself or the
 Government procurator's office.
 Art. 375-7
       The father and mother whose child gave occasion for a measure of educational assistance keep their parental
 authority over him and exercise all the attributes of it that are not incompatible with the implementation of the measure.
 They may not emancipate the child without authorization of the juvenile judge, while the measure of educational
 assistance is being implemented
       Where it was necessary to place the child outside the parents' home, the latter keep a right of correspondence and
 a right of access. The judge shall fix the terms thereof and may even, if the welfare of the child so requires, decide that
 the exercise of these rights or of one of them shall be temporarily suspended."The judge may indicate that the locamlity
 of placement of the child shall be chosen so as to make easier, as far as possible, the exercise of the right of access for
 the parent or parents" (Act no 98-657 of 29 July 1998).
 Art. 375-8
       The expenses of support and education of the child who was the subject of a measure of educational assistance
 continue to devolve upon its father and mother as well as upon his ascendants from whom maintenance may be
 claimed, except for the power of the judge to discharge them of it in whole or in part.
 Art. 375-9
       (Act no 2002-303 of 4 March 2002).- The judgment which, under Article 375-3, paragraph 3, entrusts the minor to
 an institution which receives persons admitted by reason of mental diseases, shall be handed down after detailed
 medical advice from a physician not belonging to the institution, for a duration which may not exceed fifteen days.
       The provision may be renewed, after medical assent given by  a psychiatrist of the receiving institution, for a
 duration of one month, renewable.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Delegation of Parental Authority
 Art. 376
 Articles 376 to 377-3
       No relinquishment or transfer relating to parental authority may be effective, unless under a judgment in the cases
 specified below.
 Art. 376-1
       A"family causes judge" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) may, where he is called to rule upon"the terms of exercise of
 parental authority or upon the education of a minor child or where he decides to entrust a child to a third person" (Act no
 87-570 of 22  July 1987), take into consideration the covenants which the father and mother may have freely concluded
 between them on this subject, unless one of them adduces serious reasons which allow him or her to revoke his or her
 consent.
 Art. 377
 (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002)
       The father and mother, jointly or separately, may, where circumstances so require, seize a judge for the purpose of
 having delegated all or part of the exercise of their parental authority to a third person, member of the family, trustworthy
 near relation, institution approved for receiving children or départemental Children's aid service.
       In case of plain disinterest or where the parents are unable to exercise all or part of parental authority, the
 individual, the body or the départemental Children's aid service who received the child may also seize the judge for
 purpose of having delegated to them parental authority wholly or partially. In all cases referred to in this Article, both
 parents shall be called in the case. Where the child concerned is the subject of a measure of educational assistance,
 delegation may occur only after opinion of the juvenile judge.
 Art. 377-1
 (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002)
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 71/268
CIVIL CODE
       Delegation, total or partial, of parental authority results from the judgment handed down by the family causes judge.
       However, a judgment of delegation may provide, for the needs of education of a child, that the father and mother, or
 one of them, shall share all or part of the exercise of parental authority with the third person delegatee. That division
 shall require consent of the parent or parents in so far as they exercise parental authority. The presumption in Article
 372-2 shall apply with regard to transactions performed by the delegator or delegators and the delegatee.
       The judge may be seized of the difficulties that a shared exercise of parental authority may produce by the parents,
 one of them, the delegatee or the Government procurator. He shall rule in accordance with the provisions of Article
 373-2-11.
 Art. 377-2
       In all cases, delegation may come to an end or be removed by a new judgment, where new circumstances are
 adduced.
       In the case where the father and mother are granted the return of the child, the"family causes judge" (Act no 93-22
 of 8 Jan. 1993) shall place on them, unless they are necessitous, reimbursement of all or part of the expenses of
 support.
       [deleted]
 Art. 377-3
       The right to consent to the adoption of a minor may never be delegated.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of the Total or Partial Withdrawal of Parental Authority
 Art. 378
 Articles 378 to 381
       By express provision of a criminal judgment, parental authority may be"totally withdrawn" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July
 1996) from the father and mother who are sentenced either as perpetrators, co-perpetrators or accomplices of a serious
 or ordinary offence committed on the person of their child, or as co-perpetrators or accomplices of a serious or ordinary
 offence committed by their child,.
       That"withdrawal" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) may be applied to ascendants other than the father and mother as
 regards that part of parental authority which they may have over their descendants.
 Art. 378-1
       The father and mother who"apart from any criminal sentence, either by maltreatment, or by usual and excessive
 consumption of alcoholic beverages or drug addiction, or by a notorious misconduct or criminal activities" or by lack of
 care or want of guidance, obviously endanger the security, health or morality of the child,"may be totally withdrawn
 parental authority" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996).
       The father and mother who, for more than two years, have intentionally abstained from exercising the rights and
 fulfilling the duties they retained under Article 375-7, may likewise"be totally withdrawn parental authority" (Act no 96-604
 of 5 July 1996).
       An action"for total withdrawal of parental authority" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) shall be brought before the
 tribunal de grande instance, either by the Government procurator's office, or by a member of the family or by the child's
 guardian.
 Art. 379
 (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996)
       A total withdrawal of parental authority ordered under one of the two preceding Articles affects by operation of law
 all the attributes, patrimonial as well as personal, connected with parental authority; in the absence of other
 determination, it extends to all minor children already born at the time of the judgment. It involves, for the child,
 dispensation from maintenance obligation, in derogation from Articles 205 to 207, unless otherwise provided by the
 judgment of withdrawal.
 Art. 379-1
 (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996)
       Instead of a total withdrawal, the judgment may be confined to ordering a partial withdrawal of parental authority,
 limited to the attributes it specifies. It may also decide that a total or partial withdrawal of parental authority will be
 effective only with regard to certain children already born.
 Art. 380
       When it orders"a total or partial withdrawal of parental authority or" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) of the right of
 custody, the court seized shall, where the other parent is dead or has lost the exercise of parental authority,
 either"designate a third person to whom the child will be temporarily entrusted" (Act no 87-570 of 22 July 1987) with the
 responsibility of requesting the organization of a guardianship, or entrust the child to the Children's aid service.
       It may take the same measures where parental authority has devolved on one of the parents through the effect"of a
 total withdrawal of parental authority ordered" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) against the other.
 Art. 381
       The father and mother who have been the subject"of a total withdrawal of parental authority" (Act no 96-604 of 5
 July 1996) or of a withdrawal of rights for one of the grounds provided for in Articles 378 and 378-1, may, by way of a
 petition, gain from the  tribunal de grande instance, by proving new circumstances, the restitution to them, in whole or in
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 72/268
CIVIL CODE
 part, of the rights of which they were deprived.
       An application for restitution may be filed only one year at the earliest after the judgment ordering"the total or partial
 withdrawal of parental authority" (Act no 96-604 of 5 July 1996) became irrevocable; in case of dismissal, it may be
 renewed only after a new period of one year. No application is admissible where, before the filing of the petition, the
 child has been placed for the purpose of adoption.
       Where restitution is granted, the Government procurator's office shall, if there is occasion, apply for measures of
 educational assistance.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Parental Authority with regard to the Property of a Child
 Art. 382
 Articles 382 to 387
       The father and mother have, subject to the distinctions that follow, the administration and enjoyment of the property
 of their child.
 Art. 383
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Statutory administration shall be exercised jointly by the father and mother where they exercise in common parental
 authority and, in the other cases, under judicial supervision, either by the father or by the mother, according to the
 provisions of the preceding Chapter.
       Statutory enjoyment is attached to statutory administration: it belongs either to the two parents jointly, or to the one
 of the father and mother who is responsible for the administration.
 Art. 384
       The right of enjoyment comes to an end :
       1° As soon as the child has completed"sixteen years" (Act no 74-631 of 5 July 1974), or even earlier when he
 contracts marriage;
       2° Through the causes which put an end to parental authority, or even, more particularly, through those which put
 an end to statutory administration;
       3° Through the causes which involve extinction of any usufruct.
 Art. 385
       The charges of such enjoyment are:
       1° Those to which usufructuaries are liable in general;
       2° The feeding, supporting and educating the child, according to his wealth;
       3° Debts which burden a succession received by the child to the extent that they must be discharged out of the
 income.
 Art. 386
       That enjoyment may not take place for the benefit of a surviving spouse who omits to make an inventory, authentic
 or under private signature, of property owed to a minor.
 Art. 387
       Statutory enjoyment does not extend to property acquired by a child through his work, or to that which is donated or
 bequeathed to him under the express condition that the father and mother may not have enjoyment of them.

 Art. 388
 (Act no 74-631 of 5 July 1974)
 Articles 388 to 487
 Articles 388 to 388-2
       A minor is an individual of either sex who has not yet reached the full age of eighteen years.
 Art. 388-1
 (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       In all proceedings relating to him, a minor capable of discernment may, without prejudice to the provisions as to his
 intervention or consent, be heard by the judge or the person appointed by the judge for that purpose. Where a minor so
 requests, his hearing may be denied only by a judgment setting out specially the grounds on which it is based.
       . He may be heard alone, with a counsel or a person of his choice. Where that choice does not appear to be
 consonant with the welfare of the child, the judge may appoint another person.
       The hearing of a minor does not confer on him the status of a party to the proceedings.
 Art. 388-2
 (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       Where, in a lawsuit, the interests of a minor appear to be in conflict with those of his statutory representatives, the
 judge of guardianships in the manner provided for in Article 389-3, or, failing which, the judge who is seized of the case
 shall appoint an ad hoc administrator who has the responsibility to represent him.

 Place
 Art. 389
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
 Articles 389 to 392
       Where parental authority is exercised in common by the twol parents, they are statutory administrators. In the other
 cases, statutory administration belongs to the parent who exercises parental authority.
 Art. 389-1
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Statutory administration is outright where the two parents exercise parental authority in common.
 Art. 389-2
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Statutory administration is placed under supervision of the judge of guardianships where one or the other of the two
 parents is dead or is"deprived of the exercise of parental authority" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002); it shall be
 likewise"in case of unilateral exercise of parental authority" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002).
 Art. 389-3
       A statutory administrator acts as an agent for the minor in all civil transactions, except cases where the law or usage
 authorizes minors to act for themselves.
       Where his interests are in conflict with those of the minor, he must have an administrator ad hoc appointed by the
 judge of guardianships."In the absence of any suit of the statutory administrator, the judge may undertake that
 appointment on request of the Government procurator's office, of the minor himself or of his own motion" (Act no 93-22
 of 8 Jan. 1993).
       Property donated or bequeathed to a minor under the condition that it shall be administered by a third person is not
 subject to statutory administration. That third person administrator has the powers conferred on him by the gift or will;
 failing which, those of an administrator under judicial supervision.
 Art. 389-4
 (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975)
       In outright statutory administration, each of the"parents" (Act no 85-1327 of 23 Dec. 1985) is deemed, with regard to
 third parties, to have received from the other the power to do alone the transactions for which a guardian would not need
 any authorization.
 Art. 389-5
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       In outright statutory administration, the parents perform together the transactions that a guardian could do only with
 the authorization of the family council.
       Failing agreement between the parents, a transaction must be authorized by the judge of guardianships.
       Even by mutual agreement, the parents may neither sell amicably, nor contribute to a partnership an immovable or
 a business concern belonging to the minor, nor contract loans on his behalf, nor waive a right for him without the
 authorization of the judge of guardianships. The same authorization is required for an amicable partition and the
 statement of liquidation shall be approved in the way provided for in Article 466.
       Where a transaction causes loss to the minor, the parents are liable for it jointly and severally.
 Art. 389-6
 (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975)
       In statutory administration under judicial supervision, an administrator must provide himself with an authorization
 from the judge of guardianships in order to perform the transactions that a guardian may do only with an authorization.
       He may do the other transactions alone.
 Art. 389-7
 (Act no 70-459 of 4 July 1970)
       As to other issues, the rules of guardianship shall apply to statutory administration, with the adjustments resulting
 from the latter's being deprived of family council and supervisory guardian, and without prejudicing, on the other part, to
 the rights that the father and mother hold under Title Of Parental Authority in particular as regards the education of the
 child and the usufruct of his property.
 Art. 390
       A guardianship must be opened where the father and mother are both dead or are"deprived of the exercise of
 parental authority" (Act no 2002-305 of 4 March 2002).
       (Ord. no 2005-759 of 4 July 2005) It must also be opened with respect to a child who has neither a father nor a
 mother.
       There is no derogation to specific statutes governing the Children's aid service.

 Art. 391
       In the case of statutory administration under judicial supervision, the judge of guardianships may at any time, either
 of his own motion, or at the request of relatives by blood or marriage or of the Government procurator's office, decide to
 open guardianship, after hearing or summoning the statutory administrator, except in emergency. The latter may not,
 from the application and until final judgment, except in cases of emergency, enter into any transaction that would require
 the authorization of the family council were a guardianship opened.
       The judge of guardianships may also decide, but only for serious reasons, to open a guardianship in the case of an
 outright statutory administration.
       In both cases, where a guardianship is opened, the judge of guardianships shall convene the family council which
 may either name the statutory administrator as guardian, or designate another guardian.
 Art. 392
       Where a [...] child happens to be acknowledged by one of his parents after the opening of a guardianship, the judge
 of guardianships may, on request of that parent, decide to substitute statutory administration to guardianship under
 Article 389-2.

 the minor has his domicile.
 Art. 394
       Where the minor's domicile is transferred to another place, the guardian shall forthwith give notice of it to the judge
 of guardianships previously seized. The latter shall forward the file of the guardianship to the judge of guardianships of
 the new domicile. Mention of that forwarding shall be kept in the court office of the arrondissement.
 Art. 395
       A judge of guardianships shall exercise a general supervision over statutory administrations and guardianships of
 his jurisdiction.
       He may convene statutory administrators, guardians and other organs of guardianship, require clarifications from,
 make observations to, and grant injunctions against them.
       He may sentence to the fine provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure those who, without lawful excuse, did not
 comply with his injunctions.
 Art. 396
       The proceedings before a judge of guardianships shall be regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure.

 Art. 340-2
       The action belongs only to the child.
       During the minority of the child, the mother, albeit a minor, is alone entitled to institute it.
       Where the mother did not acknowledge the child, where she is dead or unable to express her intention, the action
 shall be instituted as provided for in Article 464, paragraph 3, of this Code.
 Art. 340-3
 (Act n° 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       An action to establish paternity must be brought against the  alleged father or against his heirs; in the absence of
 heirs or where they have renounced the succession, against the State, the renouncing heirs being nevertheless joined in
 the action in order to maintain their rights.
 Art. 340-4
       An action must be instituted within two years after the child's birth, on pain of lapse.
       (Act n° 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993) Where however the alleged father and the mother have lived, during the statutory
 period of conception, in a state of concubinage involving, in the absence of community life, an enduring or continuous
 relationship, the action may be instituted until the expiry of a period of two years following the ending of the
 concubinage. Where the alleged father contributed to the support, the education or the settling of the child in the

 capacity of a father, the action may be instituted until the expiry of a period of two years following the ending of that
 contribution.
       Where an action was not instituted during the minority of the child, the latter may institute it during two years after
 his coming of age.
 Art. 340-5
       Where it entertains the action, the court may, on petition of the mother, order the father to reimburse her for all or
 part of her maternity and support expenses during the three months preceding and the three months following the birth,
 without prejudice to damages she may claim under Articles 1382 and 1383.
 Art. 340-6
       The court shall rule, if there is occasion, on the attribution of name and on parental authority, under Articles 334-3
 and"372" (Act n° 2002-305 of 4 March 2002).
 Art. 340-7
       When dismissing the petition, the judges may, however, allow subsidies to the child, if the relationship between the
 mother and the defendant was proved in the way provided for in Articles 342 and following.
 Art. 341
 (Act n° 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993)
       Maternity suits are allowed subject to Article 341-1.
       The child who brings the action must prove that he is the one to whom the alleged mother has given birth.

 evidence.
 Art. 341-1

 Art. 397
       The individual right to select a guardian, relative or not, belongs only to the last dying of the father and mother,
 where he or she has kept, on the day of death, the exercise of statutory administration or guardianship.
 Art. 398
       That appointment may be made  only in the form of a will or of a special declaration before a notaire.
 Art. 399 and 400
       [repealed]
 Art. 401
       A guardian selected by the father or mother may not be compelled to accept guardianship, unless he is furthermore
 within the class of the persons to whom, failing that special selection, the family council might have assign the duty
 thereof.
 Art. 402
       Where no guardian was selected by the last dying of the father and mother, guardianship of a [deleted, Act no
 2002-305 of 4 March 2002] child is conferred on the one of the ascendants who is of the closest degree.
 Art. 403
       In case of concurrence between ascendants of the same degree, the family council shall designate the one among
 them who will be guardian.
 Art. 404
       Where there is neither testamentary guardian nor ascendant guardian, or where the one who was designated in that
 capacity happens to cease his office, a guardian shall be given to the minor by the family council.
 Art. 405
       That council shall be convened by the judge of guardianships, either of his own motion or on submission therefor
 made to him by relatives by blood or marriage of the father and mother, creditors or other parties concerned or the
 Government procurator's office. Any person may complain to the judge against the fact that will give occasion to the
 appointment of a guardian.
 Art. 406
       A guardian shall be designated for the duration of a guardianship.
       The family council may however provide for his replacement in the course of the guardianship where serious
 circumstances so require, without prejudice to cases of excuse, incapacity or removal.

                                Of the Family Council
 Art. 407
 Articles 407 to 416
       A family council is composed of four to six members, including the supervisory guardian, but not the guardian or the
 judge of guardianships.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 76/268
CIVIL CODE
       They shall be designated by the judge for the duration of the guardianship. The judge may, however, without
 prejudice to Articles 428 and following, provide of his own motion for the replacement of one or several members in the
 course of guardianship in order to respond to changes which may occur in the condition of the parties.
 Art. 408
       The judge of guardianships shall select the members of the family council among the relatives by blood or marriage
 of the father and mother of the minor, in appraising all the circumstances of the case: nearness of degree, place of
 residence, ages and abilities of the parties concerned.
       He must avoid, as far as possible, leaving one of the two lines without representation. But he shall have regard,
 above all, to the usual relations which the father and mother had with the various relatives by blood or marriage, as well
 as to the interest that those relatives have shown or appear to be able to show to the person of the child. 
Art. 409
       The judge of guardianships may also call upon, to form part of the family council, friends, neighbours or any other
 persons whom he considers able to take interest in the child.
 Art. 410
       A family council is convened by the judge of guardianships. It shall be so where convening is required either by two
 of its members, or by the guardian or supervisory guardian, or by the minor himself provided he is of the full age
 of"sixteen years" (Act no 74-631 of 5 July 1974).
       (Act no 98-381 of 14 May 1998) A family council shall also be convened on the request of a minor under sixteen
 and capable of discernment, unless otherwise decided with particular reasons by the judge. 
Art. 411
       Notice convening a meeting  must be served at least eight days before the meeting.
       (Act no 98-281 of 14 May 1998) Previously to that meeting, the judge shall hold a hearing of the minor capable of
 discernment in the way provided for in Article 388-1.
 Art. 412
       Members of the family council are obliged to attend meetings in person. Each one, however, may be represented by
 a relative by blood or marriage of the father and mother of the minor, where that relative is not already, in his own name,
 a member of the family council. A husband may represent his wife or reciprocally.
       Members of the family council who, without a lawful excuse, are neither present nor validly represented, shall incur
 the fine provided for by the Code of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 413
       Where the judge of guardianships considers that a judgment may be handed down without the holding of a meeting
 being necessary, he shall notify to each one of the members of the council the text of the decision to be taken with
 appropriate clarifications.
       Each of the members shall cast his vote by letter missive within the period fixed to him by the judge; failing which,
 he shall incur the fine provided for by the Code of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 414
       A family council may deliberate only where at least half of its members are present or represented. Where that
 number is not attained, the judge may, either adjourn the meeting or, in case of emergency, take the decision himself.
 Art. 415
       A family council is presided over by the judge of guardianships, who is entitled to vote with a casting vote in case of
 a parity of votes.
       The guardian must attend the meetings; he is heard but does not vote, nor does the supervisory guardian where he
 represents the guardian.
       (Act no 98-381 of 14 May 1998) A minor capable of discernment may, where the judge does not consider it contrary
 to his welfare, attend meetings in an advisory capacity. A minor over the full age of sixteen must be called where the
 meeting was convened on his requisition.
       In no case may his consent to a transaction discharge the guardian and the other organs of guardianship from their
 liabilities.
 Art. 416
       Resolutions of a family council are void where they were obtained by fraud or deception, or where substantive
 formalities were omitted.
       Invalidity is remedied by a new resolution equivalent to a confirmation under Article 1338.
       An action for annulment may be brought by the guardian, the supervisory guardian, members of the family council
 or by the Government procurator's office, within two years following the resolution, as well as by the ward become of age
 or emancipated, within two years following his coming of age or his emancipation. Prescription does not run where there
 was deception or fraud, until the fact is discovered.
       Transactions performed under a nullified resolution are themselves voidable in the same manner. The period,
 however, runs from the transaction and not from the resolution.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 417
       The family council, having regard to the abilities of the persons concerned and the composition of the patrimony to
 be administered, may decide that the guardianship will be divided between a guardian to the person and a guardian to
 the property, or that the management of particular property will be entrusted to a deputy guardian.
       Guardians so appointed shall be independent, and not liable to each other, in their respective functions, unless
 otherwise ordered by the family council.
 Art. 418
       Guardianship is a personal office.
       It does not extend to a guardian's spouse. Where, however, that spouse intrudes into the management of the ward's
 patrimony, he or she becomes jointly and severally liable with the guardian for all management subsequent to the
 intrusion.
 Art. 419
       Guardianship does not extend to a guardian's heirs. The latter are liable only for the management of their
 predecessor; and, where they are adults, they are bound to continue it until the appointment of a new guardian.
 Art. 420
       In every guardianship, there shall be a supervisory guardian, appointed by the family council among its members.
       The functions of a supervisory guardian consist in the supervision of the management of the guardian and in
 representing a minor where his interests conflict with those of the guardian.
       Where he observes some mismanagement, he must, on pain of incurring personal liability, immediately inform the
 judge of guardianships of it.
 Art. 421
       Where a guardian intrudes into the management before the appointment of a supervisory guardian, he may be
 dismissed from the guardianship, if there was fraud on his part, without prejudice to compensation due to the minor.
 Art. 422
       [repealed]
 Art. 423
       Where a guardian is a relative by blood or marriage of the minor only in one line, the supervisory guardian shall be
 taken, as far as possible, from the other line.
 Art. 424
       A supervisory guardian does not replace as of right a guardian who died or became under a disability, or who
 disclaims the guardianship; but he then shall, on pain of damages that may result from it to the minor, seek the
 appointment of a new guardian.
 Art. 425
       The office of a supervisory guardian comes to an end at the same time as that of the guardian.
 Art. 426
       A guardian may not seek the dismissal of a supervisory guardian or vote in the family councils that are convened for
 that purpose.

 Art. 428
 Articles 427 to 448
       Save the father and mother in the case of Article 391, persons to whom age, illness, remoteness, exceptionally
 absorbing professional or family activities or a previous guardianship render that new office particularly heavy, may be
 dispensed from guardianship.
 Art. 429
       Save the father and mother, may be discharged from guardianship persons who cannot continue to perform it
 because of one of the causes provided for by the preceding Article, where it occurred since the appointment.

 (Act no 89-487 of 10 July 1989)
       Where a guardianship remains vacant, the judge of guardianships shall remit it to the State if it concerns an adult,

 Art. 437
       A family council shall rule on the excuses of the guardian and the supervisory guardian; the judge of guardianships
 on the excuses offered by members of the family council.
 Art. 438
       Where an appointed guardian is present in person at the resolution which remits guardianship to him, he shall
 immediately, and on pain of having all subsequent claims declared non-admissible, offer his excuses on which the family
 council shall deliberate.
 Art. 439
       Where he was not present in person, he shall, within eight days of notice of appointment being served upon him,
 have the family council convened to deliberate on his excuses.
 Art. 440
       Where his excuses are rejected, he may make application to the tribunal de grande instance to have them
 accepted; but he is bound to administer temporarily pending suit.
 Art. 441

 of the causes of incapacity, exclusion, dismissal or challenge expressed below.
 Art. 442
       Are incapable of the various duties of guardianship:
       1° Minors, save the father or mother;
       2° Adults under guardianship, insane persons and adults under curatorship.
 Art. 443
       Are excluded or dismissed by operation of law from the various duties of guardianship:
       1° Those who were sentenced to an afflictive or infamous punishment or to whom exercise of the duties of
 guardianship was forbidden under Article  42 [131-26] of the Penal Code.
       They may, however, be admitted to the guardianship of their own children, upon assent of the family council.
       2° Those who have been deprived of parental authority.
 Art. 444
       May be excluded or dismissed from the various duties of guardianship people of notorious misconduct and those
 whose improbity, usual negligence  or inability for business has been established.
 Art. 445
       Those who have, or whose father and mother have with the minor a controversy calling into question the status of
 the latter or a significant part of his property must resign and may be challenged as to the various duties of guardianship.
 Art. 446
       Where a member of the family council is subject to exclusion, dismissal or challenge, the judge of guardianships
 shall decide himself, either of his own motion, or on demand of the guardian, of the supervisory guardian or of  the
 Government procurator's office.
 Art. 447
       Where a cause for exclusion, dismissal or challenge relates to a guardian or a supervisory guardian, the family
 council shall decide. It shall be convened by the judge of guardianships, either of his own motion, or on demand made
 by the persons mentioned in Article 410 or by the Government procurator's office.
 Art. 448
       A guardian or supervisory guardian may be excluded, dismissed or challenged only after being heard or summoned.
       Where he accepts the resolution, mention shall be made thereof and a new guardian or supervisory guardian shall
 take office at once.
       Where he does not accept, he may make an application to vacate under the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure;
 but the judge of guardianships may, if he considers that there is an emergency, prescribe  forthwith interim measures for
 the welfare of the minor.

 intention which the father and mother may have expressed on this subject.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 450
       A guardian shall take care of the person of the minor and shall represent him in all civil transactions, save the cases
 where the law or usage authorizes minors to act for themselves.
       He shall administer his property like a prudent administrator and be liable for the damages that would result from his
 mismanagement.
       He may not buy the minor's property or take it on lease for rent or farm lease, unless the family council has
 authorized the supervisory guardian to make a lease with him, or accept the assignment of any right or claim against his
 ward.
 Art. 451
       A guardian shall administer and act in that capacity from the day of his appointment, where it was made in his
 presence; otherwise, from the day when notice of it was served upon him.
       Within the ten days which follow, he shall require the lifting of seals, if they were affixed, and shall at once have an
 inventory of the minor's property made, in the presence of the supervisory guardian. An office copy of that inventory
 shall be sent to the judge of guardianships.
       Failing an inventory within the prescribed period, the supervisory guardian shall refer the matter to the judge of
 guardianships for the purpose of its being made, on pain of being jointly and severally liable with the guardian for all
 orders rendered in favour of the ward. Default of inventory shall authorize the ward to make proof of the value and
 composition of his property by any means, even common repute.
       Where a minor owes something to the guardian, the latter shall so declare in the inventory, on pain of forfeiture, on
 the demand that the public officer is required to make to him, and  mention of which shall be made in the memorandum.
 Art. 452
       Within the three months which follow the initiating of a guardianship, a guardian shall convert into registered
 securities or deposit all the bearer securities belonging to the minor into an account opened in the name of the minor
 and mentioning the minority, with a depositary accredited by the Government to receive funds and securities of wards,
 unless he is authorized to sell them as provided for in Articles 457 and 468.
       He shall similarly, and under the same reservation, convert into registered securities or deposit with an accredited
 depositary the bearer securities that the minor receives afterwards, in whatever manner, within the same period of three
 months after the entry into possession.
       He may not withdraw the bearer securities deposited as provided for in the preceding paragraphs, or convert
 registered securities into bearer securities, unless conversion is made through a depositary accredited by the
 Government
       The family council may, if necessary, fix a longer period for the performance of such operations.
 Art. 453
       A guardian may give a receipt for funds which he receives for the account of the ward only with the
 counter-signature of the supervisory guardian
       Those funds shall be deposited by him into an account opened in the name of the minor and mentioning the
 minority, with a depositary accredited by the Government to receive funds and securities of wards.
       Deposit is to be made within the period of one month after the receiving of funds; where that period elapses, the
 guardian is, as of right, debtor for the interests.
 Art. 454
       On the initiating of a guardianship, the family council shall determine at a roof estimate, and according to the
 importance of the property managed, the sum annually available  for the support and education of the ward, the
 expenses of administration of his property, as well as possibly the allowance that may be granted to the guardian.
       The same resolution shall specify whether the guardian is authorized to put on the account the salaries of
 particulars administrators or agents for whose assistance he may ask, under his own responsibility.
       The family council may also authorize the guardian to make a contract for the management of the marketable
 securities of the ward. The resolution shall designate the contracting third party having regard to his solvency and
 professional experience, and specify the terms of the contract. Notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary, the
 contract may, at any time, be terminated in the name of the ward.
 Art. 455
       A family council shall determine the sum at which shall begin for the guardian the responsibility to reinvest the liquid
 capital of the minor, as well as the surplus of the income. That reinvestment shall be made within a period of six months,
 save extension by the family council. Where that period elapses, the guardian is as of right accountable for the interests.
       The nature of the property that may be acquired in reinvestment shall be determined by the family council, either in
 advance, or on the occasion of each transaction.
       In any case, third parties shall not be guarantors of the reinvestment.
 Art. 456
       As a representative of a minor, a guardian shall perform all acts of administration alone.
       He may thus transfer, for value, movables of current use and property having character of profits.
       Leases agreed to  by a guardian do not confer on the lessee, against a minor become of age, any right to renewal
 or any right to remain on the premises at the expiry of the lease, notwithstanding any statutory provision to the contrary.
 Those provisions, however, shall not apply to leases granted before the instituting of the guardianship and renewed by

 the guardian.
       Transactions which, for the management of the marketable securities of the ward, must be deemed acts of
 administration entering into the responsibilities and powers, either of statutory administrators and guardians, or of
 accredited depositaries, shall be determined by decree in Conseil d'Etat.
 Art. 457
       A guardian may not, without being thereto authorized by the family council, make transfers in the name of the minor.
       Without that authorization, he may not, in particular, borrow for the ward, or dispose of or encumber with real rights
 immovables, business concerns, marketable securities and other incorporeal rights, or movables which are precious or
 constitute an important part of the ward's patrimony.
 Art. 458
       In giving its authorization, a family council may prescribe all steps it considers appropriate, in particular as to the
 reinvestment of the funds.
 Art. 459
       A sale of immovables and business concerns that belong to a minor shall be done publicly by auction, in the
 presence of the supervisory guardian, subject to the conditions laid down by Articles 953 and following of the Code of
 Civil Procedure [Articles 1271 and following of the new Code of Civil Procedure].
       A family council may, however, authorize an amicable sale, either by public auction with an opening bid it shall fix,
 or by private agreement, at prices and terms it shall determine. In case of amicable auction, an outbidding may always
 be made, as provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure.
       A contribution to a partnership of an immovable or business concern may take place by private agreement  It must
 be authorized by the family council on the report of an expert whom the judge of guardianships shall designate.
       Marketable securities registered on an official list shall be sold through the agency of a stockbroker [a
 broker-dealer].
       Other marketable securities shall be sold by auction through the agency of a stockbroker [a broker-dealer] or a
 notaire designated in the resolution which authorizes the sale. The family council may, however, on the report of an
 expert designated by the judge of guardianships, authorize the sale of it by private agreement at prices and under terms
 it shall determine.
 Art. 460
       The authorization required by Article 457 for the transfer of property of a minor shall not apply where a judgment
 has ordered a sale by auction on request of a co-owner of the property held undivided.
 Art. 461
       A guardian may accept a succession accruing to a minor only under benefit of inventory. The family council may,
 however, by a special resolution, authorize him to accept it unconditionally where the assets manifestly exceed the
 liabilities.
       A guardian may not repudiate a succession accruing to a minor without an authorization of the family council.
 Art. 462
       In case the succession repudiated in the name of a minor has not been accepted by any one else, it may be
 retaken, either by the guardian authorized for that purpose by a new resolution of the family council, or by the minor
 when he has come of age; but in the condition in which it is at the time it is retaken and without any possibility of review
 of the sales and other transactions lawfully performed during the vacancy.
 Art. 463
       A guardian may accept without authorization gifts and specific legacies accruing to the ward, unless they are
 encumbered with charges.
 Art. 464
       A guardian may, without authorization, lodge a claim relating to patrimonial rights of the minor. He may likewise
 abandon the proceedings. The family council may enjoin him to initiate an action, to abandon it, or to make offers for the
 purpose of abandonment, on pain of being liable.
       A guardian may defend alone an action brought against the minor, but he may acquiesce in it only with the
 authorization of the family council.
       An authorization of the family council is always required for actions relating to non-patrimonial rights.
 Art. 465
       A guardian may not, without an authorization of the family council, file an application for partition in the name of the
 minor; but he may, without that authorization, reply to an application for partition brought against the minor or join in a
 collective petition for the purpose of partition, lodged by all the parties concerned under Article 822.
 Art. 466
       In order to produce with regard to a minor the same full effect as it would do between adults, a partition must be
 made in court, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 815 and following.
       The family council may, however, authorize an amicable partition, even partial. In that case, it shall designate a
 notaire to proceed thereto. The statement of liquidation, to which shall be attached the resolution of the family council,
 must be submitted to the approval of the tribunal de grande instance.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 81/268
CIVIL CODE
       Any other partition shall be considered as only provisional.
 Art. 467
       A guardian may compromise in the name of the minor only after having the family council approve the terms of the
 compromise.
 Art. 468
       In all cases where the authorization of the family council is required for the validity of an act of the guardian, it may
 be substituted by that of the judge of guardianships, where the act to be made involves property the capital value of
 which does not exceed a sum that is fixed by decree1.
       The judge of guardianships may also, on request of a guardian, authorize a sale of marketable securities instead
 and in place of the family council where it appears to him that there would be danger in delay, but on condition that a
 report be made as soon as possible to the family council which will decide on the reinvestment.
       1 D. no 65-961 of 5 Nov. 1965 : 1000 000 F (15 300 €)
                        SECTION IV
                        Of the Accounts of Guardianship and of Liabilities
 Art. 469
       Every guardian is accountable for his management when it comes to an end.
 Art. 470
 Articles 469 to 475
       Before the end of a guardianship, a guardian is bound to deliver each year to the supervisory guardian an account
 of management. That account shall be written and delivered without cost, on unstamped paper.
       (Act no 95-125 of 8 Feb. 1995) The supervisory guardian shall transmit the account with his comments to the clerk
 in chief of the tribunal d'instance who may ask him any information. In case of difficulty, the clerk in chief shall report to
 the judge of guardianships who may convene the family council, without prejudice to the power of the judge to get
 communication of the  account and supervise it at any time.
       Where a minor reaches the full age of"sixteen years" (Act no 74-631 of 5 July 1974), the judge of guardianships
 may decide that the account shall be communicated to him.
 Art. 471
       Within the three months following the end of a guardianship, a final account shall be rendered, either to the minor
 himself, having become of age or emancipated, or to his heirs. The guardian shall advance the costs of it; they shall be
 charged to the ward.
       A guardian must be allowed therein all expenses sufficiently warranted and made for a useful purpose.
       Where a guardian happens to cease his functions before the end of the guardianship, he shall render a
 recapitulatory account of his management to the new guardian who may accept it only with the authorization of the
 family council, upon the comments of the supervisory guardian.
 Art. 472
       A minor come of age or emancipated may approve an account of guardianship only one month after the guardian
 gave it to him, against a receipt, with supporting documents. An approval given before the end of the period is void.
       Also void is any agreement entered into between the ward, become of age or emancipated, and him who was his
 guardian where it has the effect of releasing the latter, in whole or in part, from his obligation to render account.
       Where an account gives rise to controversies, they shall be prosecuted and adjudged as provided for in the Title Of
 Accounting of the Code of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 473
       Approval of an account does not prejudice actions for compensation that may belong to a ward against a guardian
 or other organs of the guardianship.
       The State is alone liable with regard to the ward, save its action of recourse if there is occasion, for damage
 resulting from whatever fault committed in the functioning of the guardianship, either by the judge of guardianships or his
 clerk,"or by the clerk in chief of the arrondissement" (Act no 95-125 of 8 Feb. 1995), or by the public administrator in
 charge of a vacant guardianship under Article 433.
       An action for damages by the ward against the State shall be brought in all cases before the tribunal de grande
 instance.
 Art. 474
       The sum to which the balance due by the guardian may amount bears interest by operation of law from the approval
 of the account and, at the latest, three months after the end of the guardianship.
       Interests on what may be due to the guardian by the minor run only from the day of demand for payment which
 followed the approval of the account.
 Art. 475
       Any action by the minor against a guardian, organs of the guardianship or the State relating to guardianship matters
 is time-barred after five years, counting from majority, even where there has been emancipation.
                CHAPTER III
                Of Emancipation
 Articles 476 to 487
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 82/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 476
 (Act no 74-631 of 5 July 1974)
       A minor is emancipated as a matter of right by marriage.
 Art. 477
 (Act no 74-631 of 5 July 1974)
       A minor, even unmarried, may be emancipated when he has reached the full age of sixteen years.
       "After the minor has been heard" (Act no 93-22 of 8 Jan. 1993), that emancipation shall be pronounced, if there are
 proper reasons, by the judge of guardianships, on request of the father and mother or of one of them.
       Where the request is filed by only one parent, the judge shall decide after hearing the other, unless the latter is
 unable to express his or her intention.
 Art. 478
 (Act no 74-631 of 5 July 1974)
       A minor left without father and mother may in the same manner be emancipated on request of the family council.
 Art. 479
       Where, in the case of the preceding Article, the guardian having taken no step, a member of the family council is of
 opinion that the minor can be emancipated, he may require the judge of guardianships to convene the council in order to
 consider the matter. The minor himself may request that convening.
 Art. 480
       The account of the administration or guardianship, as the case may be, is rendered to an emancipated minor in the
 way provided for in Article 471.
 Art. 481
       An emancipated minor is capable, like an adult, of all transactions of civil life.
       He must however, in order to marry or give himself in adoption, comply with the same rules as if he was not
 emancipated.
 Art. 482
       An emancipated minor ceases to be under the authority of his father and mother.
       The latter are not liable as of right, in their sole capacity as father or mother, for damage that he may cause to
 others after his emancipation.
 Art. 483 to 486
       [repealed]
 Art. 487
 (Act no 74-631 of 5 July 1974)
       An emancipated minor may not be a merchant.
        TITLE XI
        OF MAJORITY AND  OF ADULTS WHO ARE PROTECTED BY THE LAW
                CHAPTER I
                General Provisions
 Art. 488
 (Act no 74-631 of 5 July 1974)
 Articles 488 to 515
 Articles 488 to 490-3
       Majority is fixed at the full age of eighteen years; at that age one is capable of all the transactions of civil life.
       Nevertheless, an adult whom an impairing of his personal faculties places in the impossibility of providing alone for
 his interests  is protected by the law, either on the occasion of a specific transaction, or in a continuous manner.
       May be likewise protected an adult who, because of his prodigality, insobriety or idleness, is in danger to fall into
 need or compromises the fulfilment of his family obligations.
 Art. 489
       In order to enter into a valid transaction, it is necessary to be of sound mind. But it is for those who seek annulment
 on that ground to prove the existence of a mental disorder at the time of the transaction.
       During the lifetime of an individual, an action for annulment may be brought only by him, or by his guardian or
 curator, where one of them was appointed for him afterwards. It is time-barred after the period provided for in Article
 1304.
 Art. 489-1
       After his death, transactions entered into by an individual, other than a gift inter vivos or a will, may be contested on
 the ground provided for in the preceding Article only in the cases listed below:
       1° Where a transaction in itself discloses proof of a mental disorder;
       2° Where it was entered into in a time when the individual was placed under judicial supervision;
       3° Where a petition was initiated before the death in order to have a guardianship or curatorship opened.
 Art. 489-2
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 83/268
CIVIL CODE
       A person who has caused damage to another when he was under the influence of a mental disorder is nonetheless
 liable to compensation.
 Art. 490
       Where mental faculties are disordered by an illness, an infirmity or feebleness due to age, the interests of the
 person are safeguarded by one of the systems of protection provided for in the following Chapters.
       The same systems of protection apply to the impairing of bodily faculties if it prevents the expression of intention.
       An impairing of mental or bodily faculties must be medically established.
 Art. 490-1
       The methods of medical treatment, in particular as to the choice between hospitalisation and care at home, are
 independent of the system of protection relating to civil interests.
       Reciprocally, the system relating to civil interests is independent of the medical treatment.
       Nevertheless,  judgments by which the judge of guardianships organizes the protection of civil interests must be
 preceded by an advice of the attending physician.
 Art. 490-2
       Whatever the system of protection applicable may be, the lodging of the protected person and the furniture with
 which it is equipped must be kept at his disposal as long as it is possible.
       Power of administration, as regards that property, allows only agreements for precarious enjoyment, which shall
 cease from the return of the protected person, despite any provision or stipulation to the contrary.
       Where it becomes necessary or it is in the interest of the protected person to dispose of rights relating to lodging or
 to transfer the furniture, the transaction must be approved by the judge of guardianships, after advice of the attending
 physician, without prejudice to the other formalities which the nature of the property may require. Souvenirs and other
 objects of a personal character must always be excepted from transfer and kept at the disposal of the protected person,
 where appropriate, thanks to the institution of treatment.
 Art. 490-3
       The Government procurator of the place of treatment and the judge of guardianships may visit or cause to be visited
 adults protected by law, whatever the system of protection applicable to them may be.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Adults under Judicial Supervision
 Art. 491
 Articles 491 to 491-6
       An adult who, for one of the causes provided for in Article 490, needs to be protected in the transactions of civil life,
 may be placed under judicial supervision.
 Art. 491-1
       Judicial supervision results from a declaration made to the Government procurator in the way provided for by the
 Code of Public Health.
       A judge of guardianships, to whom proceedings in guardianship or curatorship have been referred, may place the
 person whom it should be advisable to protect under judicial supervision, pending suit, by an interim order transmitted to
 the Government procurator.
 Art. 491-2
       An adult placed under judicial supervision keeps the exercise of his rights.
       However, the transactions he entered into and the undertakings he contracted may be rescinded for ordinary loss or
 abated in case of excess, even though they may not be annulled  under Article 489.
       Courts shall take into consideration, on this subject, the wealth of the protected person, the good or bad faith of
 those who dealt with him, the usefulness or uselessness of the transaction.                             An action for rescission or
 abatement may be brought, during the lifetime of the person, by all those who would have standing to petition for the
 opening of a guardianship and, after his death, by his heirs. It is time-barred after the period provided for in Article 1304.
 Art. 491-3
       Where a person has appointed an agent for the purpose of administering his property, either before, or after being
 placed under judicial supervision, that agency must be fulfilled.
       However, where a power of attorney expressly mentions that it was given on account of the period of supervision, it
 may, during that period, be revoked by the principal only with the authorization of the judge of guardianships.
       In all cases, the judge, either of his own motion, or on request of one of the parties who would have standing to
 request the opening of a guardianship, may order the revocation of the agency.
       He may also, even of his own motion, order that"the accounts be submitted to the clerk in chief of the tribunal
 d'instance for approval, without prejudice to the power of the judge to exercise himself that supervision" (Act no 95-125
 of 8 Feb. 1995).
 Art. 491-4
       In the absence of an agency, the rules of management of another’s business shall be followed.
       However, those who would have standing to request the opening of a guardianship are under the obligation to do
 the acts of preservation necessitated by the management of the patrimony of the protected person where they had
 knowledge of their urgency as well as of the declaration for purpose of supervision. The same obligation falls under the
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 84/268
CIVIL CODE
 same conditions on the director of the treating institution or, possibly, on the one who shelters at his home the person
 under supervision.
       An obligation to do acts of preservation involves, with regard to third parties, the corresponding power.
 Art. 491-5
       Where  there is occasion to act outside the cases defined in the preceding Article, any party concerned may give
 notice thereof to the judge of guardianships.
       The judge may, either appoint a special agent for the purpose of doing a specific transaction or a series of
 transactions of the same nature, within the limits of what a guardian might do without the authorization of the family
 council, or decide of his own motion to open a guardianship or a curatorship, or direct the party concerned to instigate
 himself the opening where he is one of those having standing to request it
 Art. 491-6
       Judicial supervision comes to an end with a new declaration certifying that the previous situation has come to an
 end, by lapse of the declaration under the periods of the Code of Civil Procedure or by its cancellation upon decision of
 the Government procurator.
       It comes also to an end with the opening of a guardianship or of a curatorship from the day when the new system of
 protection takes effect.
                CHAPTER III
                Of Adults in Guardianship
 Art. 492
 Articles 492 to 507
       A guardianship shall be opened where an adult, for one of the causes provided for in Article 490, needs to be
 represented in a continuous manner in the transactions of civil life.
 Art. 493
       The opening of a guardianship shall be ordered by the judge of guardianships on request of the person whom there
 is occasion to protect, of his or her spouse, unless community of living has ceased between them, of his or her
 ascendants or descendants, brothers and sisters, of the curator or of the Government procurator; it may also opened by
 the judge of his own motion.
       Other relatives by blood or marriage, or friends, may only make known to the judge the cause that could justify the
 opening of a guardianship. It shall be likewise with the attending physician and the director of the institution.
       The persons referred to in the two preceding paragraphs may, even where they did not intervene into the case,
 appeal to the tribunal de grande instance against a judgment which opened a guardianship.
 Art. 493-1
       The judge may order the opening of a guardianship only where the impairing of mental or bodily faculties of the sick
 person was ascertained by a specialist chosen from a list established by the Government procurator.
       The opening of a guardianship shall be ordered in the way provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 493-2
       Judgments opening, modifying or withdrawing a guardianship may be enforced against third parties only two
 months after mention of them was made in the margin of the record of birth of the protected person, as provided for in
 the Code of Civil Procedure.
       Even failing that mention, they are nevertheless enforceable against third parties who had personal knowledge of
 them.
 Art. 494
       A guardianship may be opened for an emancipated minor as for an adult.
       As regards a non-emancipated minor, a petition may even be initiated and adjudged during the last year of minority;
 but guardianship shall take effect only from the day when he comes of age.
 Art. 495
       Shall apply also to guardianships of adults the rules prescribed by Sections 2, 3 and 4 of Chapter II of Title X of this
 Book for guardianships of minors, save, however, those which relate to the education of the child and, in addition, under
 the following amendments.
 Art. 496
       A spouse is the guardian of the other spouse, unless community of living has ceased between them or the judge is
 of opinion that another reason prevents his or her being entrusted with guardianship. All other guardians are dative.
       A guardianship of an adult may be conferred on a juridical person.
 Art. 496-1
       Nobody, except the spouse, descendants and juridical persons may be compelled to hold guardianship of an adult
 beyond five years. On the expiry of that period, the guardian may request and shall gain his replacement.
 Art. 496-2
       An attending physician may not be a guardian or a supervisory guardian of his patient. But the judge of
 guardianships may always call on him to participate in the family council in an advisory capacity.
       A guardianship may not be conferred on a treating institution, or on any person holding therein a gainful occupation
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 85/268
CIVIL CODE
 unless they are one of those who had standing to request the opening of a guardianship. An executive employee of the
 institution may however be designated as manager of the guardianship in the circumstances referred to in Article 499.
 Art. 497
       Where there is"a relative by blood or by marriage" (Act no 96-452 of 28 May 1996) qualified for managing the
 property, the judge of guardianships may decide that he shall manage it as a statutory administrator, without a
 supervisory guardian or a family council, in accordance with the rules that apply, as regards the property of a minor, to
 statutory administration under judicial supervision.
 Art. 498
       There is no occasion to open a guardianship which would devolve on a spouse where the interests of a protected
 person can be provided for adequately in accordance with the matrimonial regime and in particular with the rules of
 Articles 217 and 219, 1426 and 1429.
 Art. 499
       Where, in consideration of the composition of the property to be managed, the judge of guardianships considers it
 useless to establish a complete guardianship, he may limit himself to designate as manager of the guardianship, without
 supervisory guardian or family council, either an executive employee belonging to the administrative staff of the treating
 institution, or a special administrator, chosen in the way provided for in a decree in Conseil d'Etat.
 Art. 500
       A manager of a guardianship shall collect the incomes of the protected person and apply them to the support and
 treatment of the latter and discharge of the maintenance obligations for which he may be liable. Where there is an
 excess, he shall deposit it into an account which he must open with an accredited depositary. Each year, he shall render
 account of his management directly to the"clerk in chief of the arrondissement, without prejudice to the power of the
 judge to request at any time from the clerk in chief communication of the account of management and direct transmittal
 of the accounting" (Act no 95-125 of 8 Feb. 1995).
       Where other acts become necessary, he shall refer the matter to the judge who may either authorize him to do
 them, or decide to establish the guardianship completely.
 Art. 501
       When opening a guardianship or in a subsequent judgment, the judge, upon opinion of the attending physician, may
 list some transactions that the person in guardianship will have the capacity to enter into himself, either alone, or with
 the assistance of the guardian or of the person standing in his stead.
 Art. 502
       All transactions entered into by a protected person after the judgment of opening of a guardianship are void as of
 right, subject to the provisions of Article 493-2.
 Art. 503
       Prior transactions may be annulled where the cause which determined the opening of the guardianship existed
 notoriously at the time when they were made.
 Art. 504
       A will made after the opening of a guardianship is void as of right.
       A will previously made remains valid, unless it is proved that, since the opening of the guardianship, the reason
 which determined the testator to so dispose has disappeared.
 Art. 505
       With authorization of the family council, gifts may be made in the name of an adult in guardianship, but only in
 favour of his descendants and by way of advancement, or in favour of the spouse.
 Art. 506
       Even in the cases of articles 497 and 499, marriage of an adult in guardianship is allowed only with the consent of a
 family council specially convened in order to consider the matter. The council may decide only after hearing the future
 spouses.
       There is no occasion for a meeting of the family council where the father and mother both give  their consent to the
 marriage.
       In all cases, the opinion of the attending physician is required.
 Art. 506-1
 (Act no 99-944 of 15 Nov. 1999)
       Adults in guardianship may not enter into a civil covenant of solidarity.
       Where, during a civil covenant of solidarity, one of the partners is placed under guardianship, the guardian
 authorized by the family council or, failing which, the judge of guardianships may put an end to the covenant  in the way
 provided for in Article 515-7, paragraph 1 or 2.
       Where the initiative to cancel the covenant is taken by the other partner, the notice mentioned in the same Article,
 paragraph 2 and 3, shall be served on the guardian.
 Art. 507
       Guardianship comes to an end with the causes that determined it; nevertheless removal of it may be ordered only in
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 86/268
CIVIL CODE
 complying with the formalities prescribed for attaining its opening and a person in guardianship may resume the exercise
 of his rights only after a judgment of removal.
       The methods of review provided for by Article 493, paragraph 3, may be resorted to only against judgments that
 refuse to give removal of a guardianship.
                CHAPTER IV
                Of Adults in Curatorship
 Art. 508
 Articles 508 to 515
       Where an adult, for one of the causes provided for in Article 490, without being unable to act for himself, has need
 of being advised or supervised in transactions of civil life, he may be placed under a system of curatorship.
 Art. 508-1
       An adult to whom Article 488, paragraph 3, refers may also be placed under a system of curatorship.
 Art. 509
       Curatorship is opened and comes to an end in the same way as a guardianship of adults.
       It is subject to the same requirements as to notice.
 Art. 509-1
       In a curatorship there is no other organ than the curator.
       A spouse is curator for the other spouse unless community of living has ceased between them or the judge is of
 opinion that another reason prevents his or her being entrusted with curatorship. All other curators must be appointed by
 the judge of guardianships.
 Art. 509-2
       The provisions relating to the duties of a guardian shall apply to the office of a curator, under the amendments
 which guardianship of adults involves.
 Art. 510
       An adult in curatorship may not, without the assistance of his curator, enter into any transaction which, under the
 system of guardianship of adults, requires an authorization of the family council. Nor may he, without that assistance,
 receive capital or make investment of it.
       Where a curator refuses his assistance to a transaction, a person in curatorship may request a suppletory
 authorization from the judge of guardianships.
 Art. 510-1
       Where an adult in curatorship has entered alone into a transaction for which the assistance of a curator was
 required, himself or the curator may seek the annulment of it.
       An action for annulment is time-barred after the period provided for in Article 1304, or even, before expiry of that
 period, in consequence of the approval that the curator may have given to the transaction.
 Art. 510-2
       Any service made on an adult in curatorship may be also made on the curator, on pain of invalidity.
 Art. 510-3
       In cases where the assistance of a curator was not required by statute, transactions into which an adult in
 curatorship may have entered alone remain nevertheless subject to actions for rescission or abatement regulated by
 Article 491-2, as though they were entered into by a person under judicial supervision.
 Art. 511
       When opening a curatorship or in a subsequent judgment, the judge, upon opinion of the attending physician, may
 list some transactions that the person in curatorship will have the capacity to enter into alone, in derogation from Article
 510, or, inversely, add other transactions to those for which that Article requires the assistance of a curator.
 Art. 512
       When appointing a curator, the judge may order that he alone shall receive the incomes of the person in
 curatorship, settle expenses with regard to third parties, and deposit the excess, if any, into an account opened with an
 accredited depositary.
       A curator appointed with that task shall render an account of his management each year to the"clerk in chief of the
 arrondissement, without prejudice to the power of the judge to request at any time from the clerk in chief communication
 of the account of management and direct transmittal of the accounting" (Act no 95-125 of 8 Feb. 1995)..
 Art. 513
       A person in curatorship may freely make his will, except for application of Article 901, if there is occasion.
       He may make a gift only with the assistance of his curator.
 Art. 514
       As regards marriage of an adult in curatorship, the consent of the curator is required; failing which, that of the judge
 of guardianships.

                CHAPTER I
                Of Civil Covenants of Solidarity
 Art. 515-1
 Articles 515-1 to 515-7
       A civil covenant of solidarity is a contract entered into by two natural persons of age, of different sexes or of a same
 sex, to organize their common life.
 Art. 515-2
       On pain of nullity, there may not be a civil covenant of solidarity:
       1° Between ascendants and descendants in direct line, between relatives by marriage in direct line and between
 collaterals until the third degree inclusive;
       2° Between two persons of whom one at least is bound by the bonds of marriage;
       3° Between two persons of whom one at least is already bound by a civil covenant of solidarity.
 Art. 515-3
       Two persons who enter into a civil covenant of solidarity shall make a joint declaration of it at the court office of the
 tribunal d'instance under the jurisdiction of which they fix their common residence.
       On pain of dismissal, they shall file with the clerk the agreement concluded between them in duplicate original and
 add the documents of civil status which allow to establish the validity of the transaction with respect to Article 515-2, as
 well as a certificate of the court office of the tribunal d'instance of their places of birth or, in case of birth abroad, of the
 court office of the tribunal de grande instance of Paris, attesting that they are not already bound by a civil covenant of
 solidarity.
       After the filing of the set of documents, the clerk shall enter that declaration into a register.
       The clerk shall countersign and date the two originals of the agreement and give them back to each partner.
       He shall have a mention of the declaration entered into a register held in the court office of the tribunal d'instance of
 the place of birth of each partner or, in case of birth abroad, in the court office of the tribunal de grande instance of Paris.
       An entry in the register of the place of residence shall attribute an undisputable date to the civil covenant of
 solidarity and render it effective against third parties.
       Any amendment to the covenant shall be the subject of a joint declaration entered at the court office that received
 the initial transaction, to which shall be added, on pain of dismissal and in duplicate original, the instrument amending
 the agreement. The formalities provided for in paragraph 4 shall apply.
       Abroad, the entry of a joint declaration of a covenant binding two partners of whom one at least is of French
 nationality, the formalities provided for in paragraphs 2 and 4 and those required in case of an amendment of the
 covenant shall be the responsibility of French diplomatic and consular agents.
 Art. 515-4
       Partners bound by a civil covenant of solidarity shall provide mutual material and moral aid to each other. The terms
 of that aid shall be fixed by the covenant.
       Partners shall be jointly and severally liable with regard to third parties for debts incurred by one of them for the
 needs of everyday life and for expenses relating to the common lodging.
 Art. 515-5
       Partners to a civil covenant of solidarity shall lay down, in the agreement referred to in Article 515-3, paragraph 2,
 whether they wish to submit to the system of undivided ownership the furniture they would acquire for value after the
 conclusion of the covenant. Failing which, that furniture shall be deemed undivided in halves. It shall be likewise where
 the date of acquisition of that property may not be established.
       The other property of which partners become owners for value after the conclusion of the covenant shall be deemed
 undivided in halves where the instrument of acquisition or of subscription does not otherwise provide.
 Art. 515-6
       The provisions of Article 832 shall apply between partners to a civil covenant of solidarity in case of dissolution of it,
 save those relating to all or part of an agricultural holding, as well as to an undivided share or to partnership shares of
 that holding.
 Art. 515-7
       Where  partners decide by mutual agreement to put an end to a civil covenant of solidarity, they shall file a joint
 written declaration with the court office of the tribunal d'instance under the jurisdiction of which one of them at least has
 his residence. The clerk shall enter that declaration into a register and shall ensure its preservation.
       Where one of the partners decides to put an end to a civil covenant of solidarity, he or she shall serve notice of his
 or her decision on the other and shall send a copy of that notice to the court office of the tribunal d'instance which
 received the initial instrument.
       Where one of the partners puts an end to a civil covenant of solidarity by marrying, he or she shall notify his or her
 decision to the other by service and shall send copies of the latter and of his or her record of birth on which mention of
 the marriage has been made, to the court office of the tribunal d'instance which received the initial instrument.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 88/268
CIVIL CODE
       Where a civil covenant of solidarity comes to an end by the death of at least one of the partners, the survivor or any
 party concerned shall send a copy of the record of death to the court office of the  tribunal d'instance which received the
 initial instrument.
       A clerk who receives a declaration or instruments provided for in the preceding paragraphs shall enter or have
 entered mention of the end of the covenant into the margin of the initial instrument. He shall also have registration of that
 mention written into the margin of the register provided for in Article 515-3, paragraph 5.
       Abroad, receiving, recording and preserving a declaration or instruments referred to in the first four paragraphs shall
 be the responsibility of French diplomatic or consular agents, who shall also undertake or have undertaken mentions
 provided for in the preceding paragraph.
       A civil covenant of solidarity shall come to an end, according to the circumstances:
       1° As soon as a mention is made in the margin of the initial instrument of the joint declaration provided for in the first
 paragraph;
       2° Three months after service delivered under paragraph 2, provided that a copy of it was brought to the knowledge
 of the clerk of the court designated in that paragraph;
       3° On the date of the marriage or of the death of one of the partners.
       Partners shall undertake themselves the liquidation of the rights and obligations resulting on their behalf from the
 civil covenant of solidarity. Failing an agreement, the judge shall rule on the patrimonial consequences of the breach,
 without prejudice to damage possibly suffered.

 BOOK II
 OF PROPERTY AND OF THE VARIOUS MODIFICATIONS OF OWNERSHIP Articles 517 to 639
        TITLE I
        OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF PROPERTY
 Art. 516
       All property is movable or immovable.
                CHAPTER I
                Of Immovables
 Art. 517
 Articles 517 to 516
 Articles 517 to 526
       Property is immovable, either by its nature or by its destination or by the object to which it applies.
 Art. 518
       Lands and buildings are immovables by their nature.
 Art. 519
       Windmills or watermills, fixed on pillars and forming part of a building, are also immovables by their nature.
 Art. 520
       Harvests standing by roots and the fruit of trees not yet gathered are also immovables.
       As soon as crops are cut and the fruit separated, even though not removed, they are movables.
       Where only a part of a harvest is cut, this part alone is movable.
 Art. 521
       The normal cutting of underwood or of timber periodically cut becomes movable only as the cutting down of trees
 proceeds.
 Art. 522
       Animals which the owner of a tenement delivers to a farmer or share cropper for farming, whether they are
 appraised or not, shall be deemed immovables so long as they remain attached to the tenement under the terms of the
 agreement.
       Animals leased to other than farmers or share croppers are movables.
 Art. 523
       Pipes used to bring water into a house or other immovable are immovables and form part of the  tenement to which
 they are attached.
 Art. 524
       "Animals and things that the owner of a tenement placed thereon for the use and working of the tenement are
 immovable by destination" (Act no 99-5 of 6 Jan. 1999).
       Thus,
       Animals attached to farming;
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 89/268
CIVIL CODE
       Farming implements;
       Seeds given to farmers or share croppers;
       Pigeons in pigeon-houses;
       Warren rabbits;
       Beehives;
       Fishes of waters not referred to in Article L. 231-3 of the Rural Code and of stretches of water referred to in Articles
 L. 431-6 and L. 431-7 of the Environmental Code;
       Wine pressers, boilers, stills, vats and barrels;
       Implements necessary for working ironworks, paper-mills and other factories;
       Straw and manure,
       are immovables by destination where they have been placed by the owner for the use and working of the tenement.
       All movables which the owner has attached to the tenement perpetually are also immovables by destination.
 Art. 525
       An owner shall be deemed to have attached movables perpetually to his tenement, where they are fastened with
 plaster or mortar or cement, or where they cannot be removed without being broken or damaged, or without breaking or
 damaging the part of the tenement to which they are affixed.
       The mirrors of an apartment shall be deemed perpetually placed where the flooring to which they have been
 fastened is part of the panelling.
       It shall be the same as to pictures and other ornaments.
       As regards statues, they are immovables where they are placed in a recess designed expressly to receive them,
 even though they can be removed without breakage or damage.
 Art. 526
       The usufruct of immovable things;
       Servitudes or land services;     
       Actions for the purpose of recovering an immovable,
       are immovables by the object to which they apply.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Movables
 Art. 527
       Property is movable by its nature or by prescription of law.
 Art. 528
 (Act no 99-5 of 6 Jan. 1999)
 Articles 527 to 536
       Animals and things which can move from one place to another, whether they move by themselves, or whether they
 can move only as the result of an extraneous power, are movables by their nature.
 Art. 529
       Obligations and actions having as their object sums due or movable effects, shares or interests in financial,
 commercial or industrial concerns, even where immovables depending on these enterprises belong to the concerns, are
 movables by prescription of law. Those shares or interests shall be deemed movables with regard to each shareholder
 only, as long as the concern lasts.
       Perpetual or life annuities, either from the State or private individuals, are also movables by prescription of law.
 Art. 530
       Any annuity established in perpetuity for the price of sale of an immovable, or as condition to a conveyance, for
 value or gratuitous, of an immovable tenement, is essentially redeemable.
       A creditor may nevertheless regulate the terms and conditions of the redemption.
       He may also stipulate that the annuity may be redeemed only after a certain time, which may never exceed thirty
 years: any stipulation to the contrary is void.
 Art. 531
       Boats, ferry-boats, ships, floating mills and baths, and generally all works which are not fastened to pillars and do
 not form part of a house, are movables: a seizure of some of these things may however, owing to their importance, be
 subject to certain special proceedings, as explained in the Code of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 532
       Materials coming from the demolition of a building, those gathered for erecting a new one, are movables until they
 are used by a worker in building operations.
 Art. 533
       The word movable, used alone in provisions of law or of man, without any other addition or designation, does not
 include ready money, precious stones, credits, books, medals, instruments of sciences, arts and professions, clothing,
 horses, carriages, weapons, grain, wine, hay and other commodities; neither does it include what is involved in a
 business.

CIVIL CODE
       The words furnishing movables include only movables intended for use and ornamentation of apartments, such as
 tapestries, beds, seats, mirrors, clocks, tables, china and other articles of such kind.
       Pictures and statues that form part of the furniture of an apartment are also included therein, but not collections of
 pictures which may be in galleries or special rooms.
       It shall be likewise of china: only that which is part of the decoration of an apartment is included under the
 denomination of furnishing movables.
 Art. 535
       The expression movable property, that of furniture or movable effects include generally every thing which is deemed
 to be a movable according to the rules above set forth.
 Art. 536
       A sale or gift of a house, with all that is found therein, does nor include ready money, or credits and other rights
 whose instruments of title may have been deposited in the house; all other movable effects are included.
                CHAPTER III
                Of Property in its Relations with Those Who Own it
 Art. 537
 Articles 537 to 543
       Private individuals have the free disposal of property which belongs to them, subject to the modifications
 established by legislation.
       Property which does not belong to private individuals is administered and may be transferred only in the forms and
 according to the rules which are peculiar to it.
 Art. 538
       Ways, roads and streets of which the State is in charge, navigable or floatable rivers and streams, beaches,
 foreshore, ports, harbours, anchorages and generally all parts of French territory which are not capable of private
 ownership are deemed to be dependencies of the Public Domain.
 Art. 539
       (Act no 2004-809 of 13 August 2004).- The property of persons who die without heirs or whose successions are
 abandoned belong to the Public Domain. 
Art. 540
       The gates, walls, ditches and battlements of fortified places and fortresses, are also part of the Public Domain.
 Art. 541
       It shall be likewise with lands, fortifications and battlements of places which are no longer fortified places: they
 belong to the State, unless they have been lawfully transferred, or ownership has been acquired by prescription against
 it.
 Art. 542
       Common property is that to whose ownership or revenue the inhabitants or one or several communes have a
 vested right.
 Art. 543
       One may have a right of ownership, or a mere right of enjoyment, or only land services to be claimed on property.
        TITLE II
        OF OWNERSHIP
 Art. 544
 Articles 547 to 546
       Ownership is the right to enjoy and dispose of things in the most absolute manner, provided they are not used in a
 way prohibited by statutes or regulations.
 Art. 545
       No one may be compelled to yield his ownership, unless for public purposes and for a fair and previous indemnity.
 Art. 546
       Ownership of a thing, either movable or immovable, gives a right to everything it produces and to what is
 accessorily united to it, either naturally or artificially.
       That right is called right of accession.
                CHAPTER I
                Of the Right of Accession to What is Produced by a Thing
 Art. 547
       Natural or cultural fruit of the land;
       Revenues;
       Increase in stock,
       belong to the owner by right of accession.
 Art. 548
 Articles 547 to 550
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 91/268
CIVIL CODE
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       Fruit produced by a thing belong to the owner only on condition that he repays the costs of ploughing, works and
 seeds incurred by third parties and whose value must be assessed at the date of repayment.
 Art. 549
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       A mere possessor makes fruits his own only where he possesses in good faith. If not, he is bound to restore the
 products with the thing to the owner who claims it; where the said products are not found in kind, their value must be
 appraised at the date of repayment.
 Art. 550
       A possessor is in good faith where he possesses as owner, under an instrument of transfer of whose defects he
 does not know.
       He ceases to be in good faith from the time those defects are known to him.
                CHAPTER II
                Of the Right of Accession to What Unites or Incorporates Itself with a Thing
 Art. 551
 Articles 551 to 577
       Everything which unites and incorporates itself with a thing belongs to the owner, according to the rules hereafter
 laid down.
 Art. 552
       Ownership of the ground involves ownership of what is above and below it.
       An owner may make above all the plantings and constructions which he deems proper, unless otherwise provided
 for in the Title Of Servitudes or Land Services.
       He may make below all constructions and excavations which he deems proper and draw from these excavations all
 the products which they can give, subject to the limitations resulting from statutes and regulations relating to mines and
 from police statutes and regulations.
 Art. 553
       All constructions, plantings and works on or inside a piece of land are presumed made by the owner, at his
 expenses and belonging to him, unless the contrary is proved; without prejudice to the ownership, either of an
 underground gallery under a building of another, or of any other part of the building, which a third party may have
 acquired or may acquire by prescription 
Art. 554
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       An owner of the ground who made constructions, plantings and works with materials which did not belong to him,
 shall pay the value of them, appraised at the date of payment; he may also be ordered to pay damages, if there is
 occasion: but the owner of the materials may not remove them.
 Art. 555
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       Where plantings, constructions or works were made by a third party and with materials belonging to the latter, the
 owner of the tenement has the right, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4, either to keep the ownership of them, or to
 compel the third party to remove them.
       Where the owner of the tenement requires to have the constructions, plantings or works suppressed, it shall be
 done at the expense of the third party, and without any compensation for him; the third party may furthermore be
 ordered to pay damages for loss which the owner of the tenement may have suffered.
       Where the owner of the tenement prefers to keep ownership of the constructions, plantings or works, he must, at his
 choice, repay the third party either a sum equal to that by which the tenement has increased in value, or the cost of the
 materials and the price of the labour appraised at the date of repayment, account being taken of the condition in which
 the said plantings, constructions or works are.
       Where the plantings, constructions or works were made by an evinced third party who would not have been liable to
 restoring the fruits owing to his good faith, the owner may not insist on the suppression of the said works, constructions
 and plantations, but he has the choice to repay the third party either of the  sums referred to in the preceding paragraph.
 Art. 556
       Deposits and accretions which gather successively and imperceptibly in tenements on the bank of a river or stream
 are called  alluvion.
       Alluvion benefits to the riparian owner, whether it be a question of a river or of a stream navigable, floatable or not;
 on condition, in the first case, that he leaves a footpath or towing-path, in accordance with regulations.
 Art. 557
       The same rule shall apply to sandbanks formed by running water which withdraws insensibly from one of its banks
 and proceeds onto the other: the owner of the uncovered bank profits from the alluvion, without the riparian owner of the
 opposite side being allowed to claim the land which he has lost.
       That right does not arise with regard to foreshore. 
Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 92/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 558
       Alluvion does not arise with regard to lakes and ponds, whose owner always keeps the land covered by the water
 when it reaches the level of the outlet of the pond, even where the volume of water decreases.
       Reciprocally, the owner of a pond does not acquire any right to the riparian lands which its water happens to cover
 during extraordinary floods.
 Art. 559
       Where a river or stream, navigable or not, removes by a sudden drift a considerable and recognizable part of a
 riparian field and carries it towards a lower field or to the opposite bank, the owner of the part removed may claim his
 property; but he is compelled to file his claim within one year: after that period, it will no longer be admissible, unless the
 owner of the field to which the part removed has been joined has not yet taken possession of it.
 Art. 560
       Islands, islets, deposits which gather in the beds of rivers or of navigable or floatable streams belong to the State,
 unless there is an instrument of title or prescription to the contrary.
 Art. 561
       Islands and deposits which gather in streams not navigable nor floatable belong to the riparian owners on the side
 where the island gathered: where the island has not gathered on one side, it belongs to riparian owners of both sides,
 beginning from a line supposedly drawn in the middle of the river.
 Art. 562
       Where a stream or river, in forming a new arm, cuts off and surrounds a field of a riparian owner and makes an
 island of it, that owner keeps the ownership of his field, although the island gathered in a river or a stream navigable or
 floatable.
 Art. 563
 (Act of 8 April 1898)
       Where a river or a stream navigable or floatable forms a new course by abandoning its former bed, the riparian
 owners may acquire ownership of that former bed, each one in his own right until a line supposedly drawn in the middle
 of the stream. The price of the former bed must be fixed by experts appointed by the president of the court of the
 location of the land, on request of the  préfet of the département.
       Where the riparian owners fail to declare, within three months of the notice served upon them by the  préfet, their
 intention to purchase at the prices fixed by the experts, the conveyance of the ancient bed must be made under the
 rules which govern alienation of the domain of the State.
       The proceeds of the sale shall be distributed as a compensation to the owners of the tenements filled by the new
 course in proportion to the value of the ground taken from each of them.
 Art. 564
       Pigeons, rabbits, fishes which go to another pigeon-house, warren or stretch of water referred to in Articles L. 431-6
 and L. 431-7] of the Environmental Code, belong to the owner of these things, provided that they were not attracted by
 fraud or guile.
 Art. 565
       Where the right of accession applies to two movable things belonging to two different masters, it depends entirely
 on the principles of natural equity.
       The following rules will serve as examples to the judge to make up his mind, in unforeseen situations, according to
 the circumstances of the case.
 Art. 566
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       Where two things belonging to different masters, which have been so joined as to form one whole, are nevertheless
 separable, so that one may subsist without the other, the whole belongs to the master of the thing which forms the main
 part, subject to the obligation of paying to the other the value, appraised at the date of payment, of the thing which has
 been jopined.
 Art. 567
       The part to which the other has been joined only for the use, ornamentation or completion of the first is deemed the
 main part.
 Art. 568
       Where, however, the thing joined is of much more value than the main thing and where it was used without the
 knowledge of the owner, the latter may request that the thing joined be separated in order to be returned to him, even
 where there may result some deterioration of the thing to which it has been joined.
 Art. 569
       Where of two things joined to form one whole, one cannot be considered as the accessory of the other, that one is
 deemed the main which has the greater value, or the greater volume where the values are approximately equal.

CIVIL CODE
       Where a craftsman or any person whatever has used material which did not belong to him to make a thing of a new
 kind, whether the material can resume its original form or not, he who was the owner of it has the right to claim the thing
 made out of it by repaying the price of the labour appraised at the date of repayment.
 Art. 571
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       Where however the labour was so important that it greatly exceeds the value of the material used, the service will
 then be deemed the main part and the workman has the right to keep the thing wrought, by repaying the owner the
 value of the material, appraised at the date of repayment.
 Art. 572
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       Where a person has partly used material which belonged to him and partly material which did not belong to him to
 make a thing of a new kind, without either of the two materials being entirely destroyed, but in such a way that they
 cannot be separated without inconvenience, the thing is common to the two owners, as to one, on account of the
 material which belonged to him, and as to the other, on account both of the material which belonged to him and of the
 price of his labour. The price of the labour must be appraised at the date of the auction sale provided for in Article 575.
 Art. 573
       Where a thing has been formed by a mingling of several materials belonging to different owners, of which none
 however can be considered as the main material, if the materials can be separated, he without whose knowledge the
 materials have been mingled may request that they be separated.
       Where the materials can no longer be separated without inconvenience, they acquire ownership of them in
 common, in proportion to the quantity, the quality and the value of the materials belonging to each of them.
 Art. 574
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       Where the material belonging to one of the owners was far superior to the other in quantity and price, then the
 owner of the material superior in value may request the thing resulting from the mingling, by repaying the other the value
 of his material, appraised at the date of repayment.
 Art. 575
       Where a thing remains in common between the owners of the materials from which it has been made, it must be
 sold by auction for their common benefit.
 Art. 576
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       In all cases where the owner whose material was used without his knowledge to make a thing of a different kind
 may claim ownership of that thing, he has the choice of requesting restitution of his material in the same kind, quantity,
 weight, measure and good quality, or its value appraised at the date of restitution.
 Art. 577
       Those who have made use of materials belonging to others, and without their knowledge, may also be ordered to
 pay damages, if there is occasion, without prejudice to criminal prosecution, if need be.
        TITLE III
        OF USUFRUCT, OF USE AND OF HABITATION
                CHAPTER I
                Of Usufruct
 Art. 578
 Articles 582 to 636
 Articles 582 to 581
       Usufruct is the right to enjoy things of which another has ownership in the same manner as the owner himself, but
 on condition that their substance be preserved.
 Art. 579
       Usufruct is established by law or by a person's wish.
 Art. 580
       Usufruct may be established outright, or at a certain date, or conditionally.
 Art. 581
       It may be established on any kind of movable and immovable property.
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Rights of a Usufructuary
 Art. 582
 Articles 582 to 599
       A usufructuary has the right to enjoy all kinds of fruits, either natural or cultural, or revenues, which the thing of
 which he has the usufruct can produce.
 Art. 583
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 94/268
CIVIL CODE
       Natural fruits are those which are the spontaneous product of the earth. The produce and increase of animals are
 also natural fruits.
       Cultural fruits of a tenement are those which are obtained by cultivation.
 Art. 584
       Revenues are rents of houses, interests on sums due, arrears of annuities.
       Prices of farming leases are also included in the class of revenues.
 Art. 585
       Natural and cultural fruits, hanging from branches or roots when a usufruct begins, belong to the usufructuary.
       Those which are in the same condition when the usufruct comes to an end, belong to the owner, without
 compensation on either side for ploughing and seeds, but also without prejudice to the portion of the fruits which may be
 acquired by a tenant paying rent in kind who may be there at the beginning or at the termination of the usufruct.
 Art. 586
       Revenues are deemed to be acquired day by day, and belong to the usufructuary in proportion to the duration of his
 usufruct. This rule shall apply to proceeds of farming leases, as well as to rents of houses and other revenues.
 Art. 587
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       Where a usufruct includes things which cannot be used without being consumed, such as money, grain, liquors, a
 usufructuary has the right to use them, but with the responsibility of returning, at the end of the usufruct, either things of
 the same quantity and quality or their value appraised at the time of restitution.
 Art. 588
       A usufruct of a life annuity also gives the usufructuary, during the duration of his usufruct, the right to collect
 arrearages of it, without being liable to any restitution.
 Art. 589
       Where a usufruct includes things which, without being consumed at once, deteriorate gradually, such as clothes or
 furnishing movables, the usufructuary has the right to make use of them for the use to which they are intended and is
 only bound to return them at the end of the usufruct in the condition in which they are, not deteriorated through his
 intentional wrong or fault.
 Art. 590
       Where a usufruct includes underwood, a usufructuary is bound to respect the order and quota of cuttings, in
 accordance with the parcelling or the uniform usage of the owners; without however compensation in favour of the
 usufructuary or of his heirs, for ordinary cuttings, either of coppice, or of staddles, or of forest trees that were not done
 during his enjoyment.
       Trees which can be removed from a tree nursery without damaging it, form part of a usufruct only on condition for
 the usufructuary of complying with the usages of the place in replacing them.
 Art. 591
       A usufructuary also benefits, always by observing the periods and usages of the former owners, by the parts of
 woods of timber trees in which periodical cuttings are made, whether those cuttings are made periodically over a certain
 extent of land, or whether they are made of a certain quantity of trees taken indiscriminately over the whole surface of
 the property.
 Art. 592
       In all other cases, a usufructuary may not interfere with woods of timber trees: he may only use the trees which
 have been uprooted or broken by accident to make the repairs which he is bound to make; he may even for that purpose
 have trees cut down, if necessary, provided the necessity of so doing is ascertained with the owner.
 Art. 593
       He may take vine props in the woods; he may also take annual or periodical products from the trees; all of which
 being done according to the usage of the country or the custom of the owners.
 Art. 594
       Fruit trees which die, even those which are uprooted or broken by accident, belong to the usufructuary, subject to
 the condition of replacing them by others.
 Art. 595
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       A usufructuary may enjoy by himself, give on lease to another, even sell or transfer his right gratuitously.
       Leases that a usufructuary made alone for a period exceeding nine years are, in case of termination of the usufruct,
 binding with regard to the bare-owner only for the time remaining to run, either of the first period of nine years where the
 parties are still in it, or of the second period, and so on in order that the lessee has only the right to conclude the
 enjoyment of the period of nine years in which he is.
       Leases of nine years or under which an usufructuary alone makes or renews more than three years before
 termination of a current lease where it relates to rural property, or more than two years before the same time where it
 relates to houses, are without effect, unless their performance began before termination of the usufruct.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 95/268
CIVIL CODE
       A usufructuary may not, without the assistance of the bare-owner, give on lease a rural tenement or an immovable
 intended for commercial, industrial or craft use. Failing assent of the bare-owner, a usufructuary may be authorized by a
 court to do that transaction alone.
 Art. 596
       A usufructuary enjoys the increase resulting from alluvion to the thing of which he has the usufruct.
 Art. 597
       He enjoys the rights of servitude, of way and generally all rights which an owner may enjoy, and he enjoys them in
 the same way as the owner himself.
 Art. 598
       He also enjoys, in the same way as the owner, mines and quarries which are being worked when the usufruct
 begins; where, however, a working which may not be carried on without a concession is concerned, a usufructuary may
 enjoy it only after gaining permission from the President of the Republic.
       He has no right to mines and quarries not yet opened, or to peat bogs whose working has not yet begun, or to a
 treasure-trove which may be discovered during the duration of the usufruct.
 Art. 599
       An owner may not, by his acts or in any manner whatsoever, injure the rights of a usufructuary.
       On his part, a usufructuary may not, on termination of the usufruct, claim any compensation for the improvements
 which he asserts to have made, even though the value of the thing has been increased thereby.
       He or his heirs may however remove mirrors, pictures and other ornaments which he may have set up, but provided
 he restores the premises to their former condition.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Obligations of a Usufructuary
 Art. 600
 Articles 600 to 616
       A usufructuary takes things in the condition in which they are; but he may enter into enjoyment only after having an
 inventory of the movables and a statement as to the immovables subject to the usufruct drawn up, the owner being
 present or he having been duly summoned.
 Art. 601
       He shall give security to enjoy as a prudent administrator, unless he is dispensed with by the instrument creating the
 usufruct; however, the father and mother who have the legal usufruct of their children's property, a seller or donor who
 reserved  the usufruct, are not obliged to give security.
 Art. 602
       Where a usufructuary does not find a security, the immovables shall be given on lease or sequestered;
       Sums included in the usufruct shall be invested;
       Commodities shall be sold and the proceeds arising out of it shall be likewise invested;
       The interest on those sums and the proceeds of leases shall belong in that case to the usufructuary.
 Art. 603
       Failing a security on the part of a usufructuary, an owner may demand that movables which fall into decay through
 use be sold, and the proceeds invested like that of commodities; the usufructuary shall then enjoy the interest during his
 usufruct: however, a usufructuary may request, and the judges may order, according to the circumstances, that a part of
 the movables necessary for his use be left to him, on his own mere guarantee given on oath, and subject to the
 condition of presenting them again on termination of the usufruct.
 Art. 604
       Delay in giving security does not deprive a usufructuary of the fruits to which he may be entitled: they are owed to
 him from the time when the usufruct began.
 Art. 605
       A usufructuary is only bound to repairs of maintenance.
       Major repairs remain the responsibility of the owner, unless they were occasioned by the lack of repairs of
 maintenance since the beginning of the usufruct; in which case the usufructuary is also liable for them.
 Art. 606
       Major repairs are those to main walls and vaults, the restoring of beams and of entire coverings;
       That of dams, breast walls and enclosing walls also in entirety.
       All other repairs are of maintenance.
 Art. 607
       Neither an owner nor a usufructuary are bound to rebuild what has fallen from decay or has been destroyed by a
 fortuitous event.
 Art. 608
       A usufructuary is liable during his enjoyment for all the annual charges upon the property, such as taxes and others
 which, according to usage, are deemed to be charges on the fruits.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 96/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 609
       As to charges that may be imposed upon the ownership for the duration of the usufruct, an owner and a
 usufructuary contribute to them as follows:
       The owner is bound to pay them and the usufructuary must account to him for interest;
       Where they are advanced by the usufructuary, he may claim the capital at the end of the usufruct.
 Art. 610
       A legacy, made by a testator, of a life annuity or of periodical payments, must be paid wholly by the universal
 legatee of the usufruct, and by a legatee by universal title of the usufruct in proportion to his enjoyment, without any
 claiming back on their part.
 Art. 611
       A specific usufructuary is not liable for debts for which the tenement is mortgaged: where he is compelled to pay
 them, he has a remedy against the owner, subject to what is provided for in Article 1020 in the Title Of Gifts Inter Vivos
 and of Wills.
 Art. 612
       A usufructuary, either universal, or by universal title, shall contribute with the owner to the payment of debts as
 follows:
       The value of the tenement subject to usufruct shall be appraised; the contribution to the debts shall be then fixed, in
 accordance with that value.
       Where a usufructuary wishes to advance the sum for which the tenement is liable, the capital shall be restored to
 him at the end of the usufruct, without any interest.
       Where a usufructuary does not wish to make that advance, the owner has the choice either to pay that sum, in
 which case the usufructuary shall account to him for interest during the duration of the usufruct, or to have a portion of
 the property subject to the  usufruct sold to the extent of the amount due.
 Art. 613
       A usufructuary is obliged to pay only the costs of the suits relating to enjoyment and of the other orders to which
 those suits may give rise.
 Art. 614
       Where during the duration of an usufruct a third party commits any encroachment upon the tenement, or interferes
 in any other way with the rights of the owner, the usufructuary is bound to notify the latter thereof; failing which, he is
 liable for all loss which may result from it to the owner, as he would be for dilapidations committed by himself.
 Art. 615
       Where an usufruct is established only over an animal which happens to die without the fault of the usufructuary, the
 latter is not bound to return another one, or to pay an appraisal of it.
 Art. 616
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       Where a herd upon which a usufruct was established perishes entirely by accident or disease and without the fault
 of the usufructuary, the latter is bound to account to the owner only for the skins, or of their value appraised at the date
 of restitution.
       Where the herd does not perish entirely, the usufructuary is bound to replace the heads of the animals that have
 perished, to the extent of the increase in stock. 
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Manner in which a Usufruct Comes to an End
 Art. 617
       A usufruct is extinguished:
       By the natural [repealed by implication] death of the usufructuary;
       By the expiry of the time for which it was granted;
 Articles 617 to 624
       By the consolidation or vesting in the same person of the two capacities of usufructuary and of owner;
       By non-user of the right during thirty years;
       By the total loss of the thing upon which the usufruct was established.
 Art. 618
       Usufruct may also cease through abuse which a usufructuary makes of his enjoyment, either by committing
 dilapidations upon the tenement, or by allowing it to decay for want of maintenance.
       Creditors of a usufructuary may intervene in controversies, for the preservation of their rights; they may offer to
 repair the dilapidations committed  and to give guarantees for the future.
       Judges may, according to the seriousness of the circumstances, order either the absolute extinguishment of the
 usufruct, or the re-entry of the owner into the enjoyment of the thing subject thereto, provided that he pays annually to
 the usufructuary, or to his assigns, a fixed sum, up to the time when the usufruct should have ceased.
 Art. 619
       A usufruct which is not granted to private individuals may last only thirty years.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 97/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 620
       A usufruct granted until a third party reaches a fixed age lasts until that time, even though the third party dies before
 the fixed age.
 Art. 621
       The sale of a thing subject to usufruct involves no change in the right of the usufructuary; he continues to enjoy his
 usufruct unless he has formally waived it.
 Art. 622
       Creditors of a usufructuary may have a waiver annulled, where it was prejudicial to them.
 Art. 623
       Where a part only of a thing subject to usufruct is destroyed, usufruct is preserved on what remains.
 Art. 624
       Where a usufruct is established only on a building, and that building is destroyed by fire or other accident, or
 collapses from decay, the usufructuary may not have the right to enjoy the ground or the materials.
       Where the usufruct was established on an area of which the building was a part, the usufructuary enjoys the ground
 and the materials.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Use and of Habitation
 Art. 625
       Rights of use and habitation are established and lost in the same manner as usufruct.
 Art. 626
 Articles 625 to 636
       They may not be enjoyed unless security has been previously given, and statements and inventories made, as in
 the case of usufruct.
 Art. 627
       A user and a person having a right of habitation shall enjoy like prudent administrators.
 Art. 628
       Rights of use and of habitation are regulated by the instruments which have established them and are more or less
 extensive, depending upon their provisions.
 Art. 629
       Where an instrument does not make clear the extent of these rights, they shall be regulated as follows.
 Art. 630
       A person who has the use of the fruits of a tenement may only demand what is necessary for his needs and those
 of his family.
       He may demand them even for the needs of children arrived since the granting of the use.
 Art. 631
       A user may neither transfer nor lease his right to another person.
 Art. 632
       He who has a right of habitation in a house, may live there with his family, even though he was not married at the
 time when that right was granted to him.
 Art. 633
       A right of habitation is restricted to what is necessary for the habitation of the person to whom that right is granted,
 and of his family.
 Art. 634
       A right of habitation may not be transferred or leased.
 Art. 635
       Where an user takes all the fruits of a tenement, or occupies the whole of a house, he is subjected to the expenses
 of cultivation, repairs of maintenance and payment of taxes, like a usufructuary.
       Where he takes only a part of the fruits or occupies only a part of a house, he shall contribute in proportion to what
 he enjoys.
 Art. 636
       Use of woods and forests is regulated by a specific legislation.
        TITLE IV
        OF SERVITUDES OR LAND SERVICES
 Art. 637
 Articles 640 to 639
       A servitude is a charge imposed on an immovable for the use and utility of another immovable belonging to another
 owner.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 98/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 638
       A servitude may not establish any pre-eminence of an immovable over the other.
 Art. 639
       It results either from the natural location of the premises, or from obligations imposed by statute, or from
 agreements between owners.
                CHAPTER I
                Of the Servitudes Originating from the Situation of the Premises
 Art. 640
 Articles 640 to 648
       Lower tenements are subjected to those which are higher, to receive waters which flow naturally from them without
 the hand of man having contributed thereto.
       A lower owner may not raise dams which prevent that flow.
       An upper owner may not do anything that worsens the servitude of the lower tenement.
 Art. 641
 (Act of 8 April 1898)
       An owner has the right to use and dispose of rainwater which falls on his tenement.
       Where the use of those waters or the course given to them worsens the natural servitude of flow established by
 Article 640, a compensation is due to the owner of the lower tenement.
       The same provision shall apply to spring waters originating on a tenement.
       Where, by borings or subterranean works, an owner causes waters to rise from his tenement, the owners of lower
 tenements must receive them; but they are entitled to compensation in case of loss resulting from their flow.
       Houses, courts, gardens, parks and enclosures adjoining dwellings may not be subjected to any worsening of the
 servitude of flow in the cases provided for in the preceding paragraphs.
       Controversies which the establishment and exercise of the servitudes provided for by these paragraphs may give
 rise to, and the settlement, if any, of the compensations due to the owners of lower tenements, must be brought, subject
 to review, before the judge of the tribunal d'instance of the canton who, in his  judgment must reconcile the interests of
 agriculture and industry with the respect due to ownership.
       If there is occasion for an appraisement, one expert only may be appointed
 Art. 642
 (Act of 8 April 1898)
       A person who has a spring on his tenement may always use the water on his wishes, within the limits and for the
 needs of his property.
       An owner of a spring may no longer use it to the detriment of the owners of the lower tenements who, for more than
 thirty years, have made and completed, on the tenement where the water springs, apparent and permanent works
 intended to use the waters and facilitating their passage within their property.
       Nor may he use them so as to deprive the inhabitants of a commune, village or hamlet, of the water which is
 necessary to them; but where the inhabitants have not acquired or prescribed the use, the owner may claim a
 compensation which shall be fixed by experts.
 Art. 643
 (Act of 8 April 1898)
       Where, as soon as they leave the tenement where they spout out, spring waters form a watercourse presenting the
 nature of public and running waters, the owner may not divert them from their natural course, to the detriment of lower
 users.
 Art. 644
       A person whose property borders running water other than that which is declared a dependency of the Public
 Domain by Article 538 in the Title Of Different Kinds of Property, may use it as it flows for irrigating his property.
       A person through whose property that water flows may even use it over the interval it runs through it, provided he
 returns it to its ordinary course when it leaves his tenements.
 Art. 645
       Where a controversy arises between owners to whom those waters may be useful, the courts, in their decisions,
 must reconcile the interests of agriculture with the respect due to ownership; and, in all cases, the special and local
 regulations on the course and use of waters must be complied with.
 Art. 646
       Any owner may compel his neighbour to a setting of boundaries of their contiguous tenements. Setting boundaries
 shall be done at common expense.
 Art. 647
       An owner may enclose his property, subject to the exception laid down in Article 682.
 Art. 648
       An owner who wishes to be enclosed loses his right to commonage and free pasture, in proportion to the land that
 he so withdraws.

Articles 653 to 652
 CIVIL CODE
                CHAPTER II
                Of the Servitudes Established by Statute
 Art. 649
       Servitudes established by statute are for the purpose of public or communal utility, or of the utility of private
 individuals.
 Art. 650
       Those established for public or communal utility have as their subjects towing-paths along navigable or floatable
 streams, the making or repairing of roads and of other public or municipal works.
       All that relates to that kind of servitudes is prescribed by statutes or specific regulations.
 Art. 651
       The law subjects owners to various obligations towards each other, independent of any agreement.
 Art. 652
       Part of those obligations are regulated by statutes on rural police;
       The others relate to party walls and common ditches, to cases in which an outer wall is necessary, to views over the
 property of a neighbour, to eaves and to right of way.
                        SECTION I
                        Of Party Wall and Common Ditch
 Art. 653
 Articles 653 to 673
       In cities and in the country, any wall serving as separation between buildings up to the point of disjunction, or
 between courtyards and gardens, and even between enclosures in fields, is deemed to be a party wall, unless there is
 an instrument of title or an indication to the contrary.
 Art. 654
       There is an indication of a non-party wall where the top of a wall is straight and perpendicular from its facing on one
 side and shows an inclined plane on the other;
       Even where there is on one side only either a coping or stone fillets and corbels which were placed there in building
 the wall.
       In such cases, a wall is deemed to belong exclusively to the owner on whose side the eaves or stone corbels and
 fillets are.
 Art. 655
       Repairing and reconstruction of a party wall must be borne by all those who have a right to it, and in proportion to
 the right of each.
 Art. 656
       However, any co-owner of a party wall may excuse himself from contributing to repairing and reconstructing by
 waiving the right in common, provided the party wall does not support a building which belongs to him.
 Art. 657
       A co-owner may build against a party wall, and place there beams or joists through the whole thickness of the wall,
 more or less fifty-four millimetres, without prejudice to a neighbour's right to have the beam shortened with a chisel down
 to half of the wall, where he himself wishes to lay beams in the same place, or to back a chimney against it.
 Art. 658
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       A co-owner may have a party wall raised; but he must pay alone the expense of the raising and of the repairs of
 maintenance above the height of the common enclosure; he must also pay alone the costs of maintenance of the
 common part of the wall due to the raising and repay to the neighbouring owner all the expenses made necessary for
 the latter by the raising.
 Art. 659
       Where a party wall is not in a condition to support a raising, the person wishing to raise it must have it entirely rebuilt
 at his own expense, and the thickness in excess must be taken on his side.
 Art. 660
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       A neighbour who did not contribute to a raising may acquire rights in common on it by paying one-half of the
 expense it has cost and the value of one-half of the ground supplied for the additional thickness, if there is any. The
 expense that the raising has cost must be appraised at the date of acquisition, account being taken of the condition in
 which the raised part of the wall is.
 Art. 661
 (Act no 60-464 of 17 May 1960)
       An owner adjoining a wall may make it a party wall in whole or in part by repaying to the master of the wall half the
 expense which it has cost, or half the expense which the part of the wall which he wishes to make a party wall has cost
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 100/268
CIVIL CODE
 and half the value of the ground on which the wall was built. The expense which the wall has cost must be appraised at
 the date of acquisition of rights in common on it, account being taken of the condition in which it is.
 Art. 662
       A neighbour may not make a recess in a party wall or apply or build up a work on it without the consent of the other,
 or, on his refusal, without having had experts determine the necessary steps in order that the new work be not
 detrimental to the other's rights.
 Art. 663
       In cities and suburbs, everyone may compel his neighbour to contribute to the constructions and repairs of an
 enclosure separating their houses, court-yards and gardens situated in those cities and suburbs: the height of the
 enclosure shall be fixed according to specific regulations or uniform and recognized usages and, failing usages and
 regulations, a dividing wall between neighbours, which will be constructed or restored in the future, shall be at least
 thirty-two decimetres high, including the coping, in cities of fifty thousand souls and more, and twenty-six decimetres in
 the others. 
Art. 664
       [repealed]
 Art. 665
       Where a party wall or a house is rebuilt, active and passive servitudes continue with regard to the new wall or the
 new house, without, however, their being allowed to become more burdensome, and provided rebuilding is made before
 prescription is acquired.
 Art. 666
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881)
       Every enclosure separating tenements is deemed to be held in common, unless there is only one property actually
 enclosed, or there is an instrument of title, prescription or indication to the contrary.
       As regards ditches, there is an indication that they are not held in common where the embankment or spoil of earth
 is found on only one side of the ditch.
       A ditch is deemed to belong exclusively to the one on whose side the spoil is situated.
 Art. 667
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881)
       A common enclosure must be maintained at common expense; but a neighbour may elude that obligation by
 waiving ownership in common.
       That power ceases where the ditch serves usually for the flowing of waters.
 Art. 668
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881)
       A neighbour whose property adjoins a ditch or a hedge not held in common may not compel the owner of that ditch
 or hedge to convey rights in common to him.
       A co-owner of a common hedge may destroy it up to the limit of his property, provided he builds a wall upon that
 limit.
       The same rule shall apply to the co-owner of a common ditch which is used only as an enclosure.
 Art. 669
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881)
       So long as a hedge is held in common, its products belong to the owners in halves.
 Art. 670
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881)
       Trees situated in a common hedge are held in common as the hedge is. Trees planted on the dividing line of two
 tenements are also deemed to be held in common. Where they die or are cut or uprooted, those trees are divided in
 halves. Fruits are gathered at joint expense and divided also in halves, either when they fall naturally, or when the fall
 was caused, or when they were picked.
       Each owner has the right to require that the trees held in common be uprooted.
 Art. 671
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881)
       It is permitted to have trees, shrubs or bushes near the limit of a neighbouring property only at the distance allowed
 by the specific regulations presently in force or by uniform and recognized usages, and failing regulations and usages, at
 the distance of two metres from the dividing line of the two tenements as regards plantations whose height exceeds two
 metres, and at the distance of half a metre as regards other plantation.
       Trees, bushes and shrubs of all kinds may be planted in espaliers on each side of a dividing wall, without having to
 keep to any distance, but they may not pass the crest of the wall.
       Where a wall is not a party wall, the owner alone has the right to lean espaliers against it.
 Art. 672
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881)
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 101/268
CIVIL CODE
       A neighbour may require that trees, shrubs and bushes planted at a distance less than the statutory distance, be
 uprooted or reduced to the height fixed in the preceding Article, unless there is an instrument of title, an adjustment
 made by the owner, or thirty-year prescription.
       Where the trees die, or where they are cut or uprooted, a neighbour may replace them only by keeping to the
 statutory distances.
 Art. 673
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881; Act of 12 Feb. 1921)
       One over whose property branches of a neighbour's trees, bushes and shrubs jut out may compel the latter to cut
 them. Fruits which have fallen naturally from these branches belong to him.
       Where roots, brambles and brushwood jut out on his property, he has the right to cut them himself up to the limit of
 the dividing line.
       The right to cut roots, brambles and brushwood or to have branches of trees, bushes or shrubs cut may not be lost
 by prescription.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Distance and Intermediate Works Required for Certain Constructions
 Art. 674
       He who has a well or a cesspool dug near a wall, whether it is a party wall or not,
       He who wishes to build a chimney or a fire-place, a forge, an oven or a furnace,
       Set a stable against it,
       Or place against that wall a store of salt or a heap of corrosive materials;
 Article 674
       Is obliged to leave the distance prescribed by regulations and specific usages relating to those things, or to do the
 works prescribed by the same regulations and usages in order to avoid injuring a neighbour.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Views over the Property of One's Neighbour
 Art. 675
 Articles 675 to 680
       One of the neighbours may not, without the consent of the other, cut in a party wall any window or opening, in any
 manner whatever, even in fixed fanlights.
 Art. 676
       The owner of a wall which is not a party wall, adjoining the property of another person, may cut openings or
 windows in it, in leaded iron and fixed fanlights.
       Those windows must be provided with an iron lattice whose meshes shall have an aperture of one decimetre (about
 three inches, eight lines) at the most, and with a frame of fixed fanlights.
 Art. 677
       Those windows or openings may only be made at twenty six decimetres (eight feet) above the floor or ground of the
 room which one wishes to give light to, where it is on the ground floor, and at nineteen decimetres (six feet) above the
 floor of the upper stories.
 Art. 678
 (Act no 67-1253 of 30 Dec. 1967)
       One may not have straight views or bow windows, or balconies or similar projections over the neighbour's property,
 whether enclosed or not, if there is not a distance of nineteen decimetres between the wall where they are cut and the
 said property, unless the tenement or the part of the tenement over which the view bears is already burdened, for the
 benefit of the tenement which profits by it, with a servitude of way which prevents the erecting of constructions.
 Art. 679
 (Act no 67-1253 of 30 Dec. 1967)
       One may not, subject to the same reservation, have side or oblique views on the same property, unless there is a
 distance of six decimetres. 
Art. 680
       The distance mentioned in the two preceding Articles counts from the outer facing of the wall in which the opening is
 cut, and, where there are balconies or other similar projections, from their exterior line up to the dividing line of the two
 tenements.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Eaves
 Art. 681
 Article 681
       An owner must make his roofs in such a way that rainwater falls on his land or on the public highway; he may not
 have it pour on his neighbour's tenement.
                        SECTION V
                        Of Right of Way
 Articles 682 to 685-1
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 102/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 682
 (Act no 67-1253 of 30 Dec. 1967)
       An owner whose tenements are enclaved and who has no way out to the public highway, or only one which is
 insufficient either for an agricultural, industrial or commercial working of his property, or for carrying out operations of
 building or development, is entitled to claim on his neighbours' tenements a way sufficient for the complete servicing of
 his own tenements, provided he pays a compensation in proportion to the damage he may cause.
 Art. 683
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881)
       The way must be taken regularly on the side where the route from the enclaved tenement to the public highway is
 shortest
       It must however be fixed at the least damageable place for the person over whose tenement it is allowed.
 Art. 684
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881)
       Where a tenement is enclosed because of its dividing in consequence of a sale, an exchange, a partition or any
 other contract, a way may be requested only on the lands which were the subject of those transactions.
       However, in the case where a sufficient way cannot be made over the divided tenements, Article 682 shall apply.
 Art. 685
 (Act of 20 Aug. 1881)
       The location and manner of a servitude of way for enclavement are established by a continuous usage for thirty
 years.
       An action for compensation in the case provided for in Article 682 is subject to be time-barred, and the way may be
 continued, although an action for compensation is no longer admissible.
 Art. 685-1
 (Act no 71-494 of 25 June 1971)
       In case of discontinuance of the enclavement and whatever be the way in which the location and manner of the
 servitude were determined, the owner of the servient tenement may, at any time, invoke the extinguishment of the
 servitude where the service of the dominant tenement is ensured under the conditions of Article 682.
       Failing amicable agreement, that disappearance must be ascertained by a judicial decision.
                CHAPTER III
                Of the Servitudes Established by the Act of Man
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Various Kinds of Servitudes Which May be Established over Property
 Art. 686
 Articles 686 to 710
 Articles 686 to 689
       Owners are permitted to establish over their property, or in favour of their property, such servitudes as they deem
 proper, provided however that the services established are laid neither on a person nor in favour of a person, but only on
 a tenement and for a tenement, and provided that those servitudes moreover are not in any way contrary to public
 policy.
       The use and extent of the servitudes thus established are regulated by the instrument which creates them; failing an
 instrument, by the following rules.
 Art. 687
       Servitudes are established either for the use of buildings, or for that of tenements.
       Those of the first kind are called urban, whether the buildings to which they are due are located in a city or in the
 country.
       Those of the second kind are named rural.
 Art. 688
       Servitudes are either continuous or discontinuous.
       Continuous servitudes are those whose usage is or may be unceasing without need of a present act of man: such
 are water-pipes, sewers, views and others of that kind.
       Discontinuous servitudes are those which need a present act of man in order to be exercised: such are rights of
 way, drawing water, pasturing and others similar.
 Art. 689
       Servitudes are apparent or non-apparent.
       Apparent servitudes are those which show themselves by outer works, such as a door, a window, an aqueduct.
       Non-apparent servitudes are those which do not have an outer sign of their existence, such as for instance a
 prohibition to build on a tenement, or to build only up to a fixed height.
                        SECTION II
                        How Servitudes are Established
 Art. 690
 Articles 690 to 696
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 103/268
CIVIL CODE
       Continuous and apparent servitudes are acquired by an instrument of title or by possession of thirty years.
 Art. 691
       Continuous non-apparent servitudes and discontinuous servitudes, whether apparent or not, may be established
 only by an instrument of title.
       Possession, even immemorial, is not sufficient to establish them, without, however, one being allowed to challenge
 today servitudes of that kind already acquired by possession in localities where they were allowed to be acquired in that
 way.
 Art. 692
       Adjustment made by the owner is equivalent to an instrument of title as to continuous and apparent servitudes.
 Art. 693
       There is an adjustment made by the owner only where it is proved that the two tenements at present divided
 belonged to the same owner and that it was through him that things were put in the condition which gives rise to the
 servitude.
 Art. 694
       Where an owner of two tenements between which an apparent sign of servitude exists, disposes of one property
 and the contract does not contain any agreement relating to the servitude, the latter continues to exist actively or
 passively in favour of the tenement conveyed or upon the tenement conveyed.
 Art. 695
       An instrument creating a servitude, with regard to those which may not be acquired by prescription, may be
 replaced only by an instrument recognizing the servitude, emanating from the owner of the tenement subjected to the
 servitude.
 Art. 696
       Where a person establishes a servitude, he is deemed to grant all that is necessary to use it.
       For instance, a servitude to draw water from another's fountain necessarily involves a right of way.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Rights of the Owner of a Tenement to Which a Servitude is Due
 Art. 697
 Articles 697 to 702
       A person to whom a servitude is due, has the right to make all works necessary to use and maintain it.
 Art. 698
       Those works shall be at his expense, and not at that of the owner of the tenement subjected to the servitude, unless
 the instrument creating the servitude provides for the contrary.
 Art. 699
       Even in the case where the owner of a tenement subjected to a servitude is compelled under the instrument to
 make the works necessary for the use or preservation of a servitude at his own expense, he may always exempt himself
 from the burden by waiving the servient tenement to the owner of the tenement to which the servitude is due.
 Art. 700
       Where a property for which a servitude was established happens to be divided, the servitude remains due for each
 portion, without however the condition of the servient tenement becoming more burdensome.
       Thus, for instance, in case of a right of way, all the co-owners are obliged to use it at the same place.
 Art. 701
       The owner of a tenement which owes a servitude may do nothing tending to diminish its use or to make it more
 inconvenient.
       Thus, he may not change the condition of the premises or remove the exercise of the servitude to a place different
 from the one where it was originally assigned.
       But however, where that original assigning has become more onerous to the owner of the servient tenement, or
 where it prevents him from making advantageous repairs on it, he may offer to the owner of the other tenement a place
 as convenient for the exercise of his rights, and the latter may not refuse it.
 Art. 702
       On his part, he who has a right of servitude may only use it in accordance with his instrument of title, without being
 allowed to make, either on the tenement which owes the servitude, or on the tenement to which it is due, any change
 which would render the condition of the former more burdensome.
                        SECTION IV
                        How Servitudes are Extinguished
 Art. 703
       Servitudes cease when things are in such a condition that they can no longer be used.
 Art. 704
 Articles 703 to 710
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 104/268
CIVIL CODE
       They revive where things are restored in such a manner that they can be used; unless time has already elapsed,
 sufficient to give rise to the presumption that the servitude is extinguished, as stated in Article 707.
 Art. 705
       A servitude is extinguished when the tenement to which it is owed, and the one which owes it, are united in the
 same hands.
 Art. 706
       A servitude is extinguished by non-user during thirty years.
 Art. 707
       The thirty years begin to run, according to the different kinds of servitudes, either from the day when one ceased to
 enjoy them, with respect to discontinuous servitudes, or from the day when an act contrary to the servitude has been
 performed, with respect to continuous servitudes.
 Art. 708
       The manner of a servitude may be time-barred like the servitude itself and in the same way.
 Art. 709
       Where a property in favour of which a servitude is established belongs to several persons in undivided ownership,
 enjoyment by one prevents prescription against all of them.
 Art. 710
       Where, among co-owners, there is one against whom prescription could not run, such as a minor, he keeps the
 rights of all the others.
 BOOK III
 OF THE VARIOUS WAYS HOW OWNERSHIP IS ACQUIRED
        General Provisions
 Art. 711
 Articles 711 to
 2283
 Articles 711 to 718
 and 719
       Ownership of property is acquired and transmitted by succession, by gift inter vivos or will, and by the effect of
 obligations.
 Art. 712
       Ownership is also acquired by accession or incorporation, and by prescription.
 Art. 713
       (Act no 2004-809 of 13 August 2004).- The property which has no master belongs to the commune on whose
 territory it is situated. However, ownership is transferred by operation of law to the Public Domain where the commune
 waives the exercise of its rights.
 Art. 714
       There are things which belong to nobody and whose usage is common to all.
       Public order statutes regulate the manner of enjoying them.
 Art. 715
       The right to hunt or fish is also regulated by specific statutes.
 Art. 716
       Ownership of a treasure trove belongs to him who discovers it on his own tenement; where a treasure trove is
 discovered on another's tenement, one half of it belongs to him who discovered it, and the other half to the owner of the
 tenement.
       A treasure trove is any hidden or buried thing of which nobody can prove ownership and which is discovered by a
 mere chance.
 Art. 717
       Rights to flotsam, to effects cast up by the sea, of whatever nature they may be, to plants and herbages which grow
 on the seashore, are also regulated by specific statutes.
       It shall be the same as to lost things whose master does not appear.

 Possession
 Art. 720
       Successions are opened by death, at the latest domicile of the deceased.
 Art. 721
       Successions devolve according to legislation where the deceased did not dispose of his property by gratuitous
 transfers.
       They may devolve through gratuitous transfers insofar as the latter are consistent with inheritable reserve.
 Art. 722
       Agreements having the purpose of creating or disclaiming rights upon all or part of a succession not yet opened or
 of a property being part of it are effective only where authorized by legislation.
 Art. 723
       Universal successors and successors by universal title are liable for an indefinite obligation to the debts of a
 succession.
 Art. 724
       Heirs designated by legislation are vested by operation of law in possession of the property, rights and actions of
 the deceased ;
       Universal legatees and donees are vested in possession in the conditions provided for in Title II of this Book.
       Failing them, succession is acquired by the State who needs a court order to take possession.
 Art. 724-1
       The provisions of this Title, in particular those which relate to option, undivided ownership and partition shall apply,
 as may be thought proper, to universal legatees or donees, or legatees or donees by universal title, save as otherwise
 provided by a specific rule.

 Art. 725
 Articles 725 to 730-5
 Articles 725 to 729-1
       In order to inherit, one must exist at the time of the opening of the succession or, having been conceived, be born
 viable.
       A person whose absence is presumed under Article 112 may inherit.
 Art. 725-1
       Where two persons, one of whom was entitled to the other's succession, die in the same event, the order of deaths
 shall be established by any means.
       Where that order may not be determined, the succession of each of them devolves without the other being called to
 it.
       Where, however, one of the co-deceased leaves descendants, the latter may represent their predecessor in title,
 when representation is allowed.
 Art. 726
       Are unworthy of inheriting and, as such, must be excluded from succession :
       1° One who is sentenced, as perpetrator or accomplice, to a serious penalty for having intentionally given or
 attempted to give death to the deceased;
       2° One who is sentenced, as perpetrator or accomplice, to a serious penalty for having intentionally struck blows at
 or committed violence or assault that provoked the deceased’s death without intention of causing it.

 violence  that provoked the deceased's death without intention of causing it;
       3° One who is sentenced for false testimony borne against the deceased  in criminal proceedings;
       4° One who is sentenced for abstaining intentionally from preventing either a serious or an ordinary offence against
 the physical integrity of the deceased, wherefrom death resulted, whereas he could do so without any danger as to him
 or third persons ;
       5° One who is sentenced for a slanderous criminal charge against the deceased where, relating to the acts
 denounced, a serious penalty was incurred ;
       May also be declared unworthy of inheriting those who have committed acts referred to in 1° and 2° above and with
 regard to whom, by reason of their death, the public right of action could not be exercised or was extinguished.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 106/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 727-1
       A declaration of unworthiness provided for in Article 727 shall be pronounced after the opening of the succession by
 the tribunal de grande instance on application of another heir. An application must be brought within six months of the
 death where the sentence or conviction precedes the death, or within six months of that  judgment where it follows the
 death.
       In the absence of heirs, a request may be filed by the Government procurator's office.
 Art. 728
       Is not excluded from succession a person entitled to inherit subject to a cause of unworthiness provided for in
 Articles 726 and 727, where the deceased, after the facts and the knowledge he had thereof, has stated by an express
 declaration of intention in the form of a will, that he intends to maintain him in his rights to succession or made a
 gratuitous transfer, universal or by universal title, in his favour.
 Art. 729
       An heir who is excluded from a succession on account of unworthiness is obliged to return all incomes and
 revenues which he enjoyed since the opening of the succession.
 Art. 729-1
       Children of an unworthy person may not be excluded on account of their parent's fault, whether they come to the
 succession on their own behalf or through representation; but an unworthy person may not, in any case, claim over the
 property of that succession the enjoyment that the law grants to the fathers and mothers over the property of their
 children.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Proof of Heirship
 Art. 730
       Proof of heirship may be made by any means.
 Articles 730 to 730-5
       No changes are made in the provisions or uniform usages relating to the issuing of certificates of ownership or
 inheritance by judicial or administrative authorities.
 Art. 730-1
       Proof of heirship may result from an affidavit drawn up by a notaire on request of one or several assigns.
       Failing an ante-nuptial agreement or last will and testament of the predecessor in title of the person who requires it,
 an affidavit may also be drawn up by the clerk in chief of the tribunal d'instance of the place of opening of the
 succession.
       An affidavit shall refer to the record of death of the person whose succession is opened and shall mention the
 supporting documents which may have been filed, such as records of civil status, and, possibly, documents relating to
 the existence of gratuitous transfers mortis causa which may affect the devolution of the succession.
       It shall contain the assertion, signed by the assign or assigns makers of the request, that they are entitled, alone or
 with others whom they specify, to come into all or part of the succession of the deceased.
       Any person whose statements seem to be useful may be called to the affidavit.
 Art. 730-2
       An assertion contained in an affidavit does not involve, per se, acceptance of the succession.
 Art. 730-3
       Faith must be given to an affidavit so established, until evidence contrary to it.
       A person who avails himself of it is presumed to have rights of succession in the percentage herein stated.
 Art. 730-4
       The heirs designated in an affidavit or their common agent are deemed, with regard to third persons possessing
 property of the succession, to have free disposal of that property and, where funds are concerned, free disposal of them
 in the percentage stated in the affidavit.
 Art. 730-5
       A person who, knowingly and in bad faith, avails himself of an inaccurate affidavit, incurs the penalties of
 concealment provided for in Article 792, without prejudice for damages.
                CHAPTER III
                Of Heirs
 Art. 731
 Articles 734 to 732
       Succession devolves by law to the relatives and spouse entitled to inherit on the following terms.
 Art. 732
       A surviving spouse non-divorced, against whom there does not exist an order of judicial separation having force of
 res judicata   is a spouse entitled to inherit.
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Rights of Relatives in the Absence of a Spouse Entitled to Inherit
 Articles 734 to 733
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 107/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 733
       (Ord no 2005-759 of 4 July 2005).- Legislation does not discriminate according to the manners of establishing
 parentage in order to determinates the relatives called to inherit.
       (Act no 2001-1135 of 3 Dec. 2001) Rights resulting from adoption are regulated in the Title Of Adoption.
                                Paragraph 1
                                Of Orders of Heirs
 Art. 734
       In the absence of a spouse entitled to inherit, relatives are called to succeed as follows:
       1° Children and their descendants;
       2° The father and mother; brothers and sisters and the descendants of the latter;
       3° Ascendants other than the father and mother;
       4° Collaterals other than brothers and sisters and the descendants of the latter.
       Each of these four categories constitutes an order of heirs which excludes the following.
 Art. 735
 Articles 734 to 740
       Children or their descendants succeed to their father and mother or other ascendants, without distinction of sex or
 primogeniture, even where born of different marriages.
 Art. 736
       Where a deceased leaves neither descendants, nor brother or sister, or descendants of the latter, his father and
 mother inherit from him, each one taking one half.
 Art. 737
       Where the father and mother have died before the deceased and the latter leaves no descendants, the brothers and
 sisters of the deceased or their descendants inherit from him, excluding the other relatives, ascendants or collaterals.
 Art. 738
       Where the father and mother outlive the deceased and the latter has no descendants, but brothers and sisters or
 descendants of the latter, one-quarter of the succession devolves to each one of the father and mother, and the
 remaining half to the brothers and sisters or to their descendants.
       Where only one of the father and mother survives, one-quarter of the succession devolves to the latter, and
 three-quarters to the brothers and sisters or to their descendants.
 Art. 739
       Failing heirs of the first two orders, succession devolves to ascendants other than the father and mother.
 Art. 740
       Failing heirs of the first three orders, succession devolves to collateral relatives of the deceased other than brothers
 and sisters and the descendants of the latter.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of Degrees
 Art. 741
 Articles 741 to 745
       The proximity of relationship is established by the number of generations; each generation is called a degree.
 Art. 742
       The sequence of degrees forms the line; the sequence of degrees between persons descending one from the other
 is called the direct line; the sequence of degrees between persons who do not descend one from the other, but who
 descend from a common ancestor, is called the collateral line.
       Descending direct line is separated from ascending direct line.
 Art. 743
       In the direct line, as many degrees are counted as there are generations between the persons: thus, a son is, with
 regard to his father, in the first degree, a grandson in the second; and reciprocally the father and grandfather with regard
 to sons and grandsons.
       In the collateral line, degrees are counted by generations from one of the relatives to and exclusive of the common
 ancestor, and from the latter to the other relative.
       Thus, two brothers are relatives in the second degree; uncle and nephew are in the third degree; first cousins in the
 fourth degree; and so on.
 Art. 744
       In each order, the heir who is in the nearest degree excludes an heir in a later degree.
       In the same degree, heirs inherit in equal shares and by heads.
       The whole, subject to what will be laid down hereafter as to division by branches and representation.
 Art. 745
       Collateral relatives may not inherit beyond the sixth degree.
                                Paragraph 3
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 108/268
CIVIL CODE
                                Of Division by Branches, Paternal and Maternal
 Articles 746 to 750
 Art. 746
       Parenthood is divided into two branches, depending on whether it proceeds from the father or the mother.
 Art. 747
       Where succession devolves to ascendants, it is divided in halves between those of the paternal branch and those of
 the maternal branch.
 Art. 748
       In each branch, the ascendant who is in the nearest degree inherits, to the exclusion of all others.
       The ascendants in the same degree inherit by heads.
       Failing an ascendant in a branch, the ascendants of the other branch shall take the whole succession.
 Art. 749
       Where succession devolves to collaterals other than brothers and sisters and their descendants, it is divided in
 halves between those of the paternal branch and those of the maternal branch.
 Art. 750
       In each branch, the collateral who is in the nearest degree inherits, to the exclusion of all others.
       The collaterals in the same degree inherit by heads.
       Failing a collateral in a branch, the collaterals of the other branch shall take the whole succession.
                                Paragraph 4
                                Of Representation
 Art. 751
 Articles 751 to 755
       Representation is a fiction of the law which causes the representative to enter into the rights of the person
 represented.
 Art. 752
       Representation takes place without limitation in the descending direct line.
       It is admitted in all cases, whether the children of the deceased compete with the descendants of a predeceased
 child, or whether all the children of the deceased having died before him, the descendants of said children are in equal
 or unequal degrees between them.
 Art. 752-1
       Representation does not take place in favour of ascendants; in each of the two lines, the nearest always excludes
 the remotest.
 Art. 752-2
       In the collateral line, representation is admitted in favour of children and descendants of brothers or sisters of the
 deceased, whether they come to the succession concurrently with uncles and aunts, or whether, all the brothers and
 sisters of the deceased having died before him, the succession devolves on their descendants in equal or unequal
 degree.
 Art. 753
       In all cases in which representation is admitted, partition shall be made by stocks, as if the represented person
 came to the succession; if there is occasion, it shall be made by subdivision of stock. Within a stock or subdivision of
 stock, partition shall be made by heads.
 Art. 754
       One represents predeceased persons, one does not represent those who have renounced.
       One may represent a person to whose succession one has renounced.
 Art. 755
       Representation is admitted in favour of the children and descendants of an unworthy heir, although the latter is alive
 on the opening of the succession.
       Children of an unworthy heir conceived before the opening of a succession of which the unworthy heir was excluded
 shall return to the succession of the latter the property they have inherited in his stead, where they come in competition
 with other children conceived after the opening of the first succession.
       Collation shall be made under the provisions of Section 2 of Chapter VI of this Title.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Rights of a Spouse Entitled to Inherit
                                Paragraph 1
                                Of the Nature of the Rights, of their Amount and Exercise
 Art. 756
 Articles 756 to 767
 Articles 756 to 758-5
       A spouse entitled to inherit is called to a succession either alone, or in competition with the relatives of a deceased.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 109/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 757
       Where a predeceased spouse leaves children or descendants, the surviving spouse shall take, at his or her option,
 either the usufruct of the whole of the existing property or the ownership of the quarter where all the children are born
 from both spouses and the ownership of the quarter in the presence of one or several children who are not born from
 both spouses.
 Art. 757-1
       Where, in the absence of children or descendants, a deceased leaves his father and mother, the surviving spouse
 shall take one half of the property. The other half devolves for one quarter to the father and for one quarter to the
 mother.
       Where the father or the mother is predeceased, the share which he would have taken devolves to the surviving
 spouse.
 Art. 757-2
       In the absence of children or descendants of the deceased or of his father and mother, the surviving spouse shall
 take the whole succession.
 Art. 757-3
       Notwithstanding Article 757-2, in case of predecease of the father and mother and in absence of descendants, the
 property that the deceased received from them by succession or gift and that is found in kind in the succession devolves
 for one half to the brothers and sisters of the deceased or to their descendants, themselves descending from the
 predeceased parent or parents from whom the devolution originates.
 Art. 758
       Where a surviving spouse takes the whole or the three quarters of the property, the ascendants of the deceased,
 other than the father and mother, who are in need are entitled to a maintenance obligation against the succession of the
 predeceased.
       The period within which it may be claimed is of one year after the death or the moment from which the heirs cease
 to perform the payments they made before to the ascendants. In case of undivided ownership the period shall be
 extended until the completion of the partition.
       Periodical payments shall be obtained from the succession. They shall be borne by all the heirs and, in case of
 insufficiency, by all the specific legatees, in proportion to what they received.
       If, however, the deceased expressly declared that such legacy should be paid in preference to the other, Article 927
 shall apply.
 Art. 758-1
       Where a surviving spouse has an option between ownership or usufruct, his or her rights may not be assigned so
 long as he or she did not exercise the option.
 Art. 758-2
       The option of a spouse between usufruct and ownership may be proved by any means.
 Art. 758-3
       Any heir may request in writing a spouse to exercise his or her option. Where he or she fails to come to a decision
 in writing within three months, the spouse shall be deemed to have chosen the usufruct.
 Art. 758-4
       Where he or she dies without having come to a decision, the spouse shall be deemed to have chosen the usufruct.
 Art. 758-5
       The calculation of the right in full ownership of a spouse provided for in Articles 757 and 757-1 must be effected on
 an aggregate formed of all the property existing at the death of his or her spouse to which shall be united fictitiously that
 which he or she has disposed with, by an act inter vivos or testamentary, in favour of persons entitled to inherit, by way
 of advancement.
       The spouse may exercise his or her right only on property which the predeceased has not disposed with by act inter
 vivos or testamentary, and without prejudicing reserved rights or rights to collation.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of the Conversion of a Usufruct
 Art. 759
 Articles 759 to 762
       Any usufruct belonging to a spouse upon the property of the predeceased, whether it results from legislation, from a
 will or from a gift of future property, gives rise to a power of conversion into a life annuity, on request of one of the heirs
 bare-owners or of the spouse himself or herself entitled to inherit.
 Art. 759-1
       A power of conversion may not be renounced . Coheirs may not be deprived of it by the intention of the
 predeceased.
 Art. 760
       Failing an agreement between the parties, an application for conversion shall be referred to the judge. It may be
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 110/268
CIVIL CODE
 instituted until final partition.
       Where he entertains the application for conversion, the judge shall determine the amount of the annuity, the
 guarantees which the debtor heirs shall give, as well as the appropriate kind of index-linking to maintain the initial
 equivalence of the annuity to the usufruct.
       The judge, however, may not order against the intention of the spouse the conversion of the usufruct bearing on the
 lodging which he or she occupies as his or her main residence, as well as on the furniture with which it is fitted.
 Art. 761
       Through an agreement between the heirs and the spouse, it may be proceeded to a conversion of the usufruct of
 the spouse into a capital.
 Art. 762
       The conversion of an usufruct is part of the performing of a partition. It does not produce a retroactive effect, save
 stipulations of the parties to the contrary.
                                Paragraph 3
                                Of the Temporary Rights to Lodging and of Rights for Life to Lodging
 Art. 763
 Articles 763 to 766
       Where, at the time of the death, a spouse entitled to inherit actually occupies, as his or her main habitation, a
 lodging belonging to the spouses or fully depending upon the succession, he or she has by operation of law, during one
 year, the gratuitous enjoyment of that lodging, as well as of the furniture, included in the succession, with which it is
 fitted.
       Where his or her habitation was secured through a lease , the rents thereof shall be repaid to him or her during the
 year, as the payments proceed.
       The rights provided for in this Article shall be deemed direct effects of the marriage and not rights of inheritance;
       This Article is mandatory.
 Art. 764
       Save intention to the contrary expressed by the deceased in the way provided for in Article 971, a spouse entitled to
 inherit who actually occupied, at the time of the death, as his or her main habitation, a lodging belonging to the spouses
 or fully depending upon the succession, has on this lodging, until his or her death, a right of habitation and a right of use
 on the furniture, included in the succession, with which it is fitted.
       Those rights of habitation and of use are exercised subject to the conditions provided for in Articles 627, 631, 634
 and 635.
       The spouse, the other heirs, or one of them may insist on an inventory of the movables and a statement of the
 immovable subjected to the rights of use and of habitation being drawn up.
       Notwithstanding Articles 631 and 634, where it results from the situation of the spouse that the lodging subject to
 the right of habitation is no longer adapted to his or her needs, the spouse or his or her representative may lease it for
 an use other than commercial or rural in order to provide necessary means for new conditions of dwelling.
 Art. 765
       The value of the rights of habitation and use shall be appropriated to the value of the rights of succession taken by
 the spouse.
       Where the value of the rights of habitation and use is lesser than that of the rights of succession, the spouse may
 take the remainder on the existing property.
       Where the value of the rights of habitation and use is higher than that of his or her rights of succession, the spouse
 is not bound to compensate the succession on account of the excess.
 Art. 765-1
       A spouse has one year after the death in order to evidence his or her intention to benefit from those rights of
 habitation and use.
 Art. 765-2
       Where the lodging was the subject of a lease, a spouse entitled to inherit who, at the time of the death, actually
 occupied the premises as his or her main habitation benefits by the right of use upon the furniture, included in the
 succession, with which it is fitted.
 Art. 766
       A spouse entitled to inherit and the heirs may, by agreement, convert the rights of habitation and use into a life
 annuity or a capital.
       Where a minor or a protected adult are among the parties to an agreement, the latter must be authorized by the
 judge of guardianships.
                                Paragraph 4
                                Of the Right to Maintenance
 Art. 767
 Article 767
       The succession of a predeceased spouse owes maintenance to a spouse entitled to inherit who is in need. The
 period within which to claim it is one year after the death or the time where the heirs cease to perform the payments they
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 111/268

 made before to the spouse. In case of undivided ownership the period shall be extended until the completion of the
 partition.
       Periodical payments shall be obtained from the succession. They shall be borne by all the heirs and, in case of
 insufficiency, by all the specific legatees, in proportion to what they received.
       If, however, the deceased expressly declared that such legacy should be paid in preference to the other, Article 927
 shall apply.
                CHAPTER IV
                Of the Rights of the State
 Art. 768
 (Ord. no 58-1307 of 23 Dec. 1958)
       In absence of heirs, a succession is acquired by the State .
 Art. 769
 (Ord. no 58-1307 of 23 Dec. 1958)
 Articles 768 to 773
       The administration of Domains which claims a right to a succession is bound to have seals affixed and to cause an
 inventory to be made in the forms prescribed  for the acceptance of successions under benefit of inventory.
 Art. 770
 (Ord. no 58-1307 of 23 Dec. 1958)
       It must petition to obtain from the tribunal de grande instance in whose territorial jurisdiction the succession was
 opened, a court order to take possession.
       It is dispensed from using the services of a counsel; the court shall rule on the petition three months and forty days
 after a notice and bill in the usual forms, and after having heard the Government procurator.
       Where, the vacancy having been duly declared, the administration of Domains has been appointed curator, it may,
 before filing its petition, proceed by itself to the formalities of notice provided for in the preceding paragraph.
       In all cases, bill-sticking shall be proved by a copy of the bill signed by the director of Domains and bearing a
 certificate of the mayor of the place of opening of the succession.
 Art. 771
       [repealed]
 Art. 772
 (Ord. no 58-1307 of 23 Dec. 1958)
       The administration of Domains which does not fulfil the formalities prescribed for it may be ordered to pay damages
 to the heirs, if any should appear.
 Art. 773
       [repealed]
                CHAPTER V
                Of the Acceptance and Repudiation of Successions
                        SECTION I
                        Of Acceptance
 Art. 774
       A succession may be accepted outright or subject to benefit of inventory.
 Art. 775
       No one is obliged to accept a succession which devolves upon him.
 Art. 776
 (Act of 18 Feb. 1938)
 Articles 774 to 814
 Articles 774 to 783
       Successions devolving on minors and on adults in guardianship may be lawfully accepted only in accordance with
 the provisions of the Title Of Minority, of Guardianship and of Emancipation.
 Art. 777
       The effects of acceptance go back to the day of the opening of the succession.
 Art. 778
       Acceptance may be express or by conduct: it is express where one assumes the title or capacity of heir in an
 authentic or private instrument; it is by conduct where the heir does an act which necessarily implies his intention of
 accepting and which he would be entitled to do only in his capacity as heir.
 Art. 779
       Acts of mere preservation, supervision and interim administration are not acts of acceptance of a succession,
 unless the title or capacity of heir has been assumed therein.
 Art. 780
       A gift, sale or assignment of his rights of inheritance made by one of the co-heirs, either to a stranger, or to all his
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 112/268
CIVIL CODE
 co-heirs, or to some of them, involves on his part acceptance of the succession.
       It shall be the same :
       1° as to the renunciation, even  gratuitous, which one of the heirs makes in favour of one or several of his co-heirs;
       2° as to the renunciation which he makes in favour of all his co-heirs without distinction, where he receives the price
 of his renunciation.
 Art. 781
       Where a person to whom a succession has devolved dies without having repudiated it or without having accepted it
 expressly or by conduct, his heirs may accept or repudiate it on his behalf.
 Art. 782
       Where those heirs do not agree as to accepting or repudiating the succession, it must be accepted under benefit of
 inventory.
 Art. 783
       An adult may attack an acceptance, express or by conduct, which he made of a succession, only in the case where
 that acceptance was the result of a deception committed upon him: he may never claim on the ground that he suffered
 loss, except only in the case where the succession is absorbed or reduced more than one-half through the discovery of
 a will unknown at the time of the acceptance.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Renunciation of Successions
 Art. 784
 Articles 784 to 792
       Renunciation of a succession may not be presumed; it may only be made at the court office of the tribunal de
 grande instance in the arrondissement  of which the succession was opened, on a special register kept for that purpose.
 Art. 785
       An heir who renounces shall be deemed to have never been an heir.
 Art. 786
       The share of a renouncing heir accrues to his co-heirs; where he is alone, it devolves upon the next degree.
 Art. 787
       One may never take by representation of an heir who renounced: where the person renouncing is the only heir in
 his degree, or where all the co-heirs renounce, children come in their own right and inherit by heads.
 Art. 788
       Creditors of one who renounces to the detriment of their rights may be authorized by the court to accept the
 succession on behalf of their debtor, in his place and stead.
       In that case, the renunciation is avoided only in favour of the creditors and to the extent only of their claims: it is not
 so in favour of the heir who renounced.
 Art. 789
       The power to accept or repudiate a succession is extinguished by the length of time required for the longest
 prescription of immovable rights.
 Art. 790
       So long as prescription of the right to accept is not effective against the heirs who renounced, they have the power
 to still accept the succession, where it has not already been accepted by other heirs; without prejudice, however, to the
 rights which third parties may have acquired to property of the succession, either by prescription, or by transactions
 lawfully entered into with the curator of the vacant succession.
 Art. 791
       One may not, even by an ante-nuptial agreement, renounce the succession of a living person or transfer contingent
 rights which one may have to that succession.
 Art. 792
       Heirs who have misappropriated or concealed items of property of a succession, are deprived of the power to
 renounce it: they remain outright heirs, notwithstanding their renunciation, without being allowed to claim any share in
 the things misappropriated or concealed.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Benefit of Inventory, of its Effects and of the Obligations of a Beneficiary
 Heir
 Art. 793
 Articles 793 to 810
       The declaration of an heir, that he intends to assume that capacity only under benefit of inventory, must be made at
 the court office of the tribunal de grande instance in the arrondissement  of which the succession was opened: it must be
 entered on the register designed for receiving acts of renunciation.
 Art. 794
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 113/268
CIVIL CODE
       That declaration is effective only where it is preceded or followed by a true and exact inventory of the property of the
 succession, in the manner prescribed by the legislation on procedure, and within the periods which shall be hereafter
 specified.
 Art. 795
       An heir has three months for making the inventory, from the day of the opening of the succession.
       He has in addition, for deliberating on his acceptance or renunciation, a period of forty days, which shall commence
 to run from the day of expiry of the three months given for the inventory, or from the day of the closing of the inventory if
 it was finished before the three months.
 Art. 796
       Where, however, there exist in the succession articles liable to waste away or costly to keep, an heir may, in his
 capacity of being entitled to inherit, and without there being an acceptance on his part thereby presumed, have himself
 authorized by the court to proceed to a sale of those articles.
       That sale must be done by a public officer, after the bills and notice regulated by legislation on procedure.
 Art. 797
       While the periods for making an inventory and deliberating are elapsing, an heir may not be compelled to assume a
 capacity and no judgment may be obtained against him: where he renounces when the periods have elapsed or before,
 the expenses which he has lawfully incurred up to that time are the responsibility of the succession.
 Art. 798
       After the expiry of the above-mentioned periods, an heir, in case of proceedings brought against him, may require a
 new period which the court to which the matter was referred may grant or refuse according to the circumstances.
 Art. 799
       The costs of the proceedings, in the case of the preceding Article, are the responsibility of the succession, where
 the heir proves either that he had no knowledge of the death, or that the periods were insufficient, either because of the
 location of the property, or because of the controversies which have arisen : where he does not make that proof, the
 costs are his personal responsibility.
 Art. 800
       Nevertheless, after the expiry of the periods granted by Article 795, and even of those given by the judge under
 Article 798, an heir keeps the power to still make an inventory and to stand as heir beneficiary, where he has not acted
 as heir or where there does not exist against him a judgment having become res judicata  which condemns him in the
 capacity of outright heir.
 Art. 801
       An heir who has been guilty of concealment or who has omitted, knowingly and in bad faith, to include articles of the
 succession in the inventory, is deprived of the benefit of inventory.
 Art. 802
       The effect of the benefit of inventory is to give an heir the advantage:
       1° To be obliged to pay the debts of the succession only to the extent of the value of the property which he receives,
 and even to be allowed to discharge himself from paying the debts by abandoning all the property of the succession to
 the creditors and legatees;
       2° Not to mingle his personal property with that of the succession, and to keep against it the right to ask for payment
 of his claims.
 Art. 803
       A beneficiary heir is responsible for administering the property of the succession, and must account for his
 administration to creditors and legatees.
       He may be constrained as to his personal property only after having been given notice to present his account, and
 having failed to comply with that obligation.
       After an auditing of the account, he may be constrained as to his personal property only to the extent of the balance
 of which he is debtor.
 Art. 804
       He is liable only for gross faults in the administration for which he has charge.
 Art. 805
       He may sell movables of the succession only through a public officer, by auction and after the usual bills and
 notices.
       Where he produces them in kind, he is liable only for depreciation or deterioration caused by his negligent conduct.
 Art. 806
       He may sell immovables only in the forms prescribed by the rules of procedure; he is obliged to transfer the
 proceeds thereof to mortgage creditors who made themselves known.
 Art. 807
       Where creditors or other persons concerned so require, he is obliged to give good and solvent security for the value
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 114/268
CIVIL CODE
 of the movables contained in the inventory and for the portion of the proceeds of the immovables not transferred to
 mortgage creditors.
       Where he fails to give that security, the movables shall be sold and the proceeds thereof deposited, as well as the
 proceeds not transferred of the immovables, for the purpose of discharging the liabilities of the succession.
 Art. 808
       Where there are attaching creditors, a beneficiary heir may pay only in the order and manner fixed by the judge.
       Where there are no attaching creditors he shall pay creditors and legatees as they present themselves.
 Art. 809
       Creditors who did not attach, who present themselves after the auditing of the account and the payment of the
 balance , may only exercise their remedies against the legatees.
       In either case, the remedy is time-barred after the lapse of three years, after the day of the auditing of the account
 and the payment of the balance.
 Art. 810
       Costs of seals, if any have been affixed, of inventory and of account, are charged against the succession.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Vacant Successions
 Art. 811
 Articles 811 to 814
       Where, after expiry of the periods for making the inventory and deliberating, no one presents himself to claim a
 succession, and there are no known heirs or the known heirs have renounced, the succession is deemed vacant.
 Art. 812
       The tribunal de grande instance in whose arrondissement  it is opened, shall appoint a curator on request of the
 persons concerned, or on demand of the Government procurator.
 Art. 813
       A curator of a vacant succession is obliged first of all to have its state of being established by an inventory: he shall
 exercise and enforce its rights; he shall answer claims brought against it; he shall administer, with the responsibility of
 having the funds forming part of the succession, as well as the proceeds from the sale of movables or immovables,
 deposited into the funds of the receiver of the national office for the preservation of rights and with the responsibility of
 accounting to whomever it may belong.
 Art. 814
       The provisions of Section III of this Chapter, on the forms of an inventory, the method of administration, and the
 accounts to be rendered by a beneficiary heir, shall apply moreover to curators of vacant successions,"insofar as they
 are not contrary to the provisions of Articles 1000 and 1001 of the Code of Civil Procedure" (Ord. no 58-1007 of 24 Oct.
 1958).
                CHAPTER VI
                Of Partition and of Collations
                        SECTION I
                        Of Undivided Ownership and of Action for Partition
 Art. 815
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
 Articles 815 to 892
 Articles 815 to 842
       No one may be compelled to remain in undivided ownership and a partition may always be induced, unless it was
 delayed by judgment or agreement.
       "On request of an undivided co-owner, a court may delay partition" (Act no 78-627 of 10 June 1978) for two years at
 the most where its immediate carrying out could affect the value of the undivided property"or where one of the undivided
 co-owners can settle in an agricultural holding depending on the succession only at the end of that period" (Act no
 80-502 of 4 July 1980). That delay may be applied to the whole of the undivided property or only to part of it.
       Furthermore, where undivided co-owners wish to remain in undivided ownership, the court may, on request of one
 or several of them, on the basis of the interests as they stand, and without prejudice to the application of Articles 832 to
 832-3, allot his share, after appraisal, to the one who sought partition, either in kind, if it can easily be disjoined from the
 remainder of the undivided property, or in money, if the allotment in kind cannot be conveniently made, or if the applicant
 expresses his preference for it; where there is not a sufficient sum in the undivided property, the complement shall be
 remitted by those of the undivided co-owners who concurred in the request, without prejudice to the possibility for the
 other undivided co-owners to participate in it if they express the wish of doing so. The share of each of them in the
 undivided property shall be increased in proportion to his remittance.
 Art. 815-1
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Failing an amicable agreement, undivided ownership of an agricultural holding forming an economic unit and whose
 development was secured by the deceased or by his or her spouse may be maintained, under the terms fixed by the
 court, on request of the persons referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 below . The court shall rule on the basis of the
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 115/268
CIVIL CODE
 interests as they stand and of the possibilities of existence which the family can derive from the undivided property. The
 maintenance of undivided ownership remains possible where the holding includes elements of which the heir or the
 spouse was already owner or co-owner before the opening of the succession.
       Undivided ownership may also be maintained on request of the same persons and under the terms fixed by the
 court, as regards ownership of premises used for habitation or for professional purposes which, at the time of the death,
 were  actually used for that habitation or for those purposes by the deceased or his or her spouse. It shall be the same
 for movable articles which are useful for the exercise of the profession.
       Where the deceased leaves one or several minor descendants, the maintenance of undivided ownership may be
 requested either by the surviving spouse, or by any heir, or by the statutory representative of the minors.
       In the absence of minor descendants, the maintenance of undivided ownership may be requested only by the
 surviving spouse and provided that he was before the death, or has become by reason of the death, co-owner of the
 agricultural holding or of the premises used for habitation or for professional purposes. If it is a case of premises used
 for habitation, the spouse must have resided on the spot at the time of the death.
       Maintenance of undivided ownership may not be prescribed for a duration longer than five years. In may be
 renewed, in the case provided for in paragraph 3, until the coming of age of the youngest of the descendants, and, in the
 case provided for in paragraph 4, until the death of the surviving spouse.
 Art. 815-2
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Any undivided owner may take the necessary steps for the preservation of the undivided property.
       He may use for that purpose funds of the undivided property which he holds, and he is deemed to have the free
 disposal of them with regards to third parties.
       Failing funds of the undivided property, he may compel his undivided co-owners to make with him the necessary
 expenditures.
       Where undivided property is encumbered with an usufruct, those powers are effective against the usufructuary to
 the extent that the latter is responsible for repairs.
 Art. 815-3
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Acts of administration and disposition relating to undivided property require the consent of all the undivided
 co-owners . They may give to one or several of them general authority for administration. A special authority is required
 for any act which does not belong to a normal management of the undivided property, as well as for the conclusion and
 renewal of leases.
       Where one undivided owner takes up the management of the undivided property, with the knowledge of the others
 and nevertheless without opposition on their part, he is deemed to have received an implied authority, covering acts of
 administration, but not acts of disposition or conclusion or renewal of contracts.
 Art. 815-4
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Where one of the undivided owners is unable to express his intention, another may be judicially entitled to represent
 him, in a general manner or for some particular transactions, the terms and extent of that representation being fixed by
 the judge. 
       Failing statutory power, contractual authority or judicial entitlement, the acts done by a undivided owner on behalf of
 another are effective with regard to the latter under the rules of management of another’s business.
 Art. 815-5
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       An undivided owner  may be judicially authorized to do alone an act for which the consent of an undivided co-owner
 would be required, where the refusal of the latter imperils the common interest.
       "The judge may not, on request of a bare-owner, order the sale of the full ownership of a property encumbered with
 an usufruct, against the wish of the usufructuary" (Act no 87-498 of 6 July 1987).
       An act made within the terms fixed by the judicial authorization is effective against the undivided owner whose
 consent was wanting.
 Art. 815-6
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       The president of the tribunal de grande instance may prescribe or authorize all urgent measures which the common
 interest requires.
       He may in particular authorize an undivided owner to collect from debtors of the undivided property or from
 depositaries of undivided money funds designed to meet urgent needs, while prescribing, where required, the terms of
 their use. That authorization does not involve qualifying as regards a surviving spouse or a heir.
       He may also, either designate an undivided owner as administrator with obligation if there is occasion of giving
 security, or appoint a sequestrer. Articles 1873-5 to 1873-9 of this Code shall apply as may be thought proper to the
 powers and obligations of the administrator, unless they are otherwise regulated by the judge.
 Art. 815-7
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       The president of the court may also prohibit the shifting of tangible movables reserving the right to specifying those
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 116/268
CIVIL CODE
 of which he grants the personal usage to one or another of the persons entitled, under the responsibility on the latter to
 give security, if he deems it  necessary.
 Art. 815-8
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Whoever collects revenues or incurs expenses for the account of the undivided ownership must keep a statement of
 them which is at the disposal of the undivided owners.
 Art. 815-9
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Each undivided owner may use and enjoy undivided property in accordance with its destination, to the extent
 compatible with the rights of the other undivided owners and with the effect of the acts lawfully made in the course of the
 undivided ownership. Failing an agreement between the persons concerned, the exercise of that right shall be regulated,
 provisionally, by the president of the court.
       An undivided owner who uses or enjoys privately an undivided thing is liable to an indemnity, unless otherwise
 agreed.
 Art. 815-10
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Fruits and revenues of undivided property accrue to the undivided ownership, in default of interim partition or of any
 other agreement establishing divided enjoyment.
       No inquiry relating to fruits and revenues may, however, be admissible more than five years after the date on which
 they were or could have been collected.
       Each undivided owner is entitled to benefits coming from undivided property and bears the loss in proportion to his
 rights in the undivided property.
 Art. 815-11
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Any undivided owner may claim his annual share in the benefits, less the expenses involved by acts to which he
 consented or which are effective against him.
       Failing another title, the extent of the rights of each in the undivided ownership results from the affidavit or from the
 abstract of inventory drawn up by the notaire.
       In case of controversy, the president of the tribunal de grande instance may order an interim distribution of the
 benefits, subject to an account to be made before the final liquidation.
       Up to the amount of available money, he may likewise order an advance in capital on the rights of an undivided
 owner in the partition to come.
 Art. 815-12
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       An undivided owner who manages one or several undivided items of property is accountable for the products of his
 management. He is entitled to compensation for his activity on terms fixed amicably or, failing which, by judicial decision.
 Art. 815-13
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Where an undivided owner has improved at his expenses the condition of undivided property, account of it must be
 taken for him according to equity, with regard to the increase in value of the property at the time of partition or of
 transfer. Account shall be taken likewise for him of the necessary outlays he made out of his own money for the
 preservation of said property, even though they did not improve it.
       Reciprocally, an undivided owner is responsible for degradations and deteriorations which have diminished the
 value of the undivided property through his act or fault.
 Art. 815-14
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       An undivided owner who intends to transfer, for value, to a person outside the undivided ownership, all or part of his
 rights in the undivided property or in one or several articles of that property shall give notice by extra-judicial act to the
 other undivided owners of the price and terms of the planned transfer as well as of the name, domicile and occupation of
 the person who intends to acquire it.
       Any undivided owner may, within the period of one month following that notice, make known to the transferor, by
 extra-judicial act, that he exercises a right of pre-emption at the price and terms of which he was notified.
       In case of pre-emption, the person who is exercising it shall have an instrument of sale drafted within a period of two
 months, counting from the date of sending his reply to the seller. After that period, his declaration of pre-emption is void
 by operation of law, fifteen days after a notice of default remained ineffective, and without prejudice to damages which
 may be claimed of him by the seller.
       Where several undivided owners exercise their rights of pre-emption, unless otherwise agreed, they are deemed to
 acquire together the portion put up for sale in proportion to their respective shares in the undivided ownership.
       Where terms of payment have been granted by the transferor, Article 833-1 shall apply.
 Art. 815-15
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 117/268
CIVIL CODE
       Where there is occasion for an auction of all or part of the rights of an undivided owner in undivided property or in
 one or more articles of that property, the counsel or notaire must inform the undivided owners of it by notice one month
 before the date planned for the sale."Each undivided owner may take the place of the purchaser within a period of one
 month after the auction, by declaration at the court office or with the notaire" (Act no 78-627 of 10 June 1978).
       The particulars established for the purpose of the sale must mention the rights of substitution.
 Art. 815-16
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Every transfer or auction made in defiance of Articles 815-14 and 815-15 is void. An action for annulment is
 time-barred after five years. It may be brought only by those on whom notices were to be served or by their heirs.
 Art. 815-17
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       Creditors who might have levied execution on the undivided property before there was undivided ownership, and
 those whose claims result from the preservation or management of the undivided property, shall be paid by deduction
 from the assets before partition. They may, in addition, conduct attachment or seizure and sale of the undivided
 property.
       Personal creditors of an undivided owner may not attach or seize the latter's share in undivided property, whether
 movable or immovable.
       They have, however, the power to instigate partition in the name of their debtor or to intervene in a partition
 instigated by him. The undivided co-owners may stop the course of the action for partition by discharging the obligation
 in the name and on behalf of the debtor. Those who exercise that power shall be reimbursed by deduction from the
 undivided property.
 Art. 815-18
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
       The provisions of Articles 815 to 815-17 shall apply to undivided property in usufruct to the extent that they are
 consistent with the rules on usufruct.
       The notices provided for in Articles 815-14, 815-15 and 815-16 must be served on any bare owner and on any
 usufructuary. But a usufructuary may acquire a share in bare ownership only where no bare owner offers to acquire it; a
 bare owner may acquire a share in usufruct only where no usufructuary offers to acquire it.
 Art. 816
       A partition may be applied for even where one of the heirs has enjoyed separately a part of the property of the
 succession, if there was no instrument of partition nor possession adequate to acquire prescription.
 Art. 817
 (Act of 19 June 1939)
       As regards minors or adults in guardianship, an action for partition may be brought by their guardians specially
 authorized by a family council.
       As regards absent coheirs, the action belongs to the relatives vested with possession.
 Art. 818
       [repealed]
 Art. 819
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Where all the heirs are present and fully capable, a partition may be made in such manner and through such act as
 the parties deem proper.
 Art. 820
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Property of a succession may, in whole or in part, be subject to measures of preservation, such as the affixing of
 seals, on request of a party concerned or of the Government procurator's office, under the conditions and following the
 forms determined by the Code of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 821
       [repealed]
 Art. 822
 (D.-Law of 17 June 1938)
       An action for partition and the controversies arising  either on the occasion of maintaining undivided ownership or
 during the proceedings of partition, shall be, on pain of annulment, submitted only to the court of the place of opening of
 the succession; it is before that court that auctions shall be made and that claims relating to the warranty of shares
 between coparceners and those for rescission of a partition shall be brought. In the case where an attempt to
 conciliation as provided for in Article 48 [repealed] of the Code of Civil Procedure takes place, the judge of the  tribunal
 d'instance of the place of opening of the succession shall alone be competent, on pain of annulment.
       (Act of 15 Dec. 1921) Where all the parties agree, the court may be seized of an application for partition through a
 collective request signed by their counsels. If there is occasion for an auction, the request shall contain an upset price
 which will serve as an appraisal. In that case, the judgment shall be handed down in chambers and is not appealable
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 118/268
CIVIL CODE
 where the submissions of the request are accepted by the court without modification.
       (Act of 19 June 1939) The provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply without need of a previous
 authorization, whatever the capacity of the party concerned may be and even where he is represented by a judicial
 agent.
 Art. 823
       Where one of the coheirs refuses to consent to a partition, or where controversies arise, either as to the way of
 proceeding, or as to the manner of settling it, the court shall decide as in summary matters, or shall appoint, if
 necessary, for the proceedings of partition, one of the judges, on whose report it shall decide the controversies.
 Art. 824
       Appraisal of the immovables shall be made by experts chosen by the parties concerned, or, upon their refusal,
 appointed by the court of its own motion.
       The memorandum of the experts shall state the basis of the appraisal; it shall indicate whether the article appraised
 can be conveniently partitioned; in what manner; finally, in case of partition, it shall fix each one of the shares that can
 be formed therefrom, and their value.
 Art. 825
       Appraisal of the movables, where there was no valuation in a regular inventory, must be made by knowledgeable
 persons, at a fair price and without increase.
 Art. 826
       Each one of the coheirs may claim his share of the movables and immovables of the succession in kind:
 nevertheless, where there are attaching or seizing creditors, or where the majority of the coheirs deem a sale necessary
 for the discharge of the debts and liabilities of the succession, movables shall be sold publicly in the ordinary manner.
 Art. 827
 (D.-Law of 17 June 1938)
       Where the immovables cannot be conveniently partitioned or allocated in the conditions provided for by this Code, a
 sale by auction must take place before the court.
       The parties, however, where they are all of full age, may consent that the auction be held before a notaire, on the
 choice of whom they agree.
 Art. 828
       After the immovables and movables have been appraised and sold, if there is occasion, the supervising judge shall
 send the parties before a notaire upon whom they agree, or whom he appoints of his own motion, if the parties do not
 agree upon a choice.
       Before that officer shall be determined the accounts of what the parties may owe each other, the formation of the
 general mass, the composition of the shares and the allotments to be made to each of the coparceners.
 Art. 829
       Each coheir shall return to the mass, according to the rules hereafter laid down, the gifts which have been made to
 him and the sums of which he is debtor.
 Art. 830
       Where collation is not made in kind, the coheirs to whom it is owed, shall appropriate an equivalent portion from the
 mass of the succession.
       Appropriations shall be made, as far as possible, on things of the same kind, character and good quality as those
 not returned in kind.
 Art. 831
       After those appropriations, out of what remains of the mass, the composition is made of as many equal shares as
 there are coparcener heirs or coparcener stocks.
 Art. 832
 (D.-Law of 17 June 1938)
       In forming  and composing shares, the parcelling out of lands and the splitting up of holdings must be avoided.
       In so far as parcelling out of lands and splitting up of holdings can be avoided, each share must, as far as possible,

       "A surviving spouse or any co-owner heir may request a preferential allotment by way of partition, under the
 responsibility of a compensation, if any, of any agricultural holding, or part of agricultural holding, constituting an
 economic unit, or undivided portion of an agricultural unit, even formed in part from a property of which he was already
 owner or co-owner before the death, in whose development he actually participates or participated; in the case of an
 heir, the requirement as to participation may have been fulfilled by his or her spouse. If there is occasion, the request for
 preferential allotment may bear on shares of the capital, without prejudice to the application of the statutory provisions or
 of articles of association on the continuation of a partnership with the surviving spouse or one or several heirs.    
       "The same rules shall apply to any commercial, industrial or craft concern, whose importance does not exclude a
 family nature" (Act no 82-596 of 10 July 1982).
       (Act no 80-502 of 4 July 1980) In the case where neither the surviving spouse, nor any co-owner heir requests the
 application of the provisions provided for in paragraph 3 above or those of Articles 832-1 or 832-2, preferential allotment

 may be granted to any coparcener provided he obliges himself to give on lease, within a period of six months, the
 property under consideration under the terms fixed in Chapter VII of Title I of Book VI [Chapter VI of Title I of Book IV] of
 the Rural Code to one or several of the coheirs fulfilling the personal requirements provided for in paragraph 3 above or
 to one or several descendants of those coheirs fulfilling the same conditions.
       A surviving spouse or any co-owner heir may also request preferential allotment :
       Of the ownership or right to lease of the premises which actually serve him or her as habitation, where he or she
 had residence here at the time of the death", with the furniture which garnishes them" (Act no 2001-1135 of 3 Dec.
 2001);
       Of the ownership or right to lease of the premises used for professional purposes which serve actually for the
 exercise of his or her occupation and of the furniture for professional purposes which garnishes the premises;
       Of the whole of movable articles necessary for the holding of a rural property farmed by the deceased as tenant
 farmer or sharecropper where the lease continues for the profit of the applicant or where a new lease is granted to the
 latter.
       Preferential allotment may be sought jointly by several persons entitled to inherit."Preferential allotment of the
 ownership of the premises and of the furniture which gaenishes it, referred to in paragraph 7, is as of right for a surviving
 spouse" (Act no 2001-1135 of 3 Dec. 2001).
       "In the circumstances referred to in the preceding paragraph, an allottee surviving spouse may require from his
 coparceners periods, which may not exceed ten years, for payment of a fraction of the balance, equal to a half at the
 most. Unless otherwise agreed, the sums remaining due bear an interest at the statutory rate.
       "In case of sale of the premises or of the furniture which garnishes them, the fraction of the balance which relates to
 it becomes immediately due; in case of partial sales, the proceeds of those sales shall be paid to the coparceners and
 appropriated to the fraction of the balance still due.
       "Rights resulting from a preferential allotment may not prejudice rights for life of use and habitation which a spouse
 may exercise under Article 764" (Act no 2001-1135 of 3 Dec. 2001).
       "Failing an amicable agreement, a request for preferential allotment shall be brought before the court, which shall
 decide on the basis of the interest as they stand; in case of several requests relating to a holding or a concern, the court
 shall take into account the fitness of the various applicants to manage that holding or concern and to remain therein, and
 in particular the duration of their personal taking part in the operation of the holding or of the concern" (Act no 82-596 of
 10 July 1982).
       Property which forms the subject of the allotment shall be appraised at its value on the day of partition.
       Unless otherwise amicably agreed between the coparceners, a balance which may be oxed shall be paid cash.
 Art. 832-1
 (Act no 80-502 of 4 July 1980)
       Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 832, paragraphs"14 and 16" (Act no 2001-1135 of 3 Dec. 2001) and unless
 maintenance in undivided ownership is requested under Articles 815, paragraph 2, and 815-1, preferential allotment
 referred to in Article 832, paragraph 3, is as of right as regards any agricultural holding which does not exceed the limits
 of surface  fixed by decree in Conseil d'Etat. In case of several requests, the court shall designate the allottee or joint
 allottees on the basis of the interests as they stand and of the fitness of the various applicants to manage the holding 
and to remain therein.
       In the circumstances referred to in the preceding paragraph, even where a preferential allotment was judicially
 granted, the allottee may require from his coparceners periods which may not exceed ten years for payment of a fraction
 of the balance, equal to a half at most. Except otherwise agreed, sums remaining due bear interest at the statutory rate.
       (Act no 61-1378 of 19 Dec. 1961) In case of sale of the whole of an allotted property the fraction of the balance
 remaining owed becomes immediately due; in case of partial sales, the proceeds of those sales shall be paid to the
 coparceners and appropriated to the fraction of the balance still due.
       [repealed]
 Art. 832-2
 (Act no 80-502 of 4 July 1980)
       Where maintenance in undivided ownership was not ordered under Articles 815, paragraph 2, and 815-1, and failing
 a preferential allotment in ownership provided for in Articles 832, paragraph 3, or 832-1, a surviving spouse or any
 co-owner heir may request preferential allotment of all or part of immovable property or rights for agricultural purposes
 depending on the succession, with a view to establishing an agricultural land grouping with one or several coheirs and,
 as the case may be, one or several third persons.
       That allotment is of right where the surviving spouse or one or several of the coheirs fulfilling the personal
 qualifications provided for in Article 832, paragraph 3, require that there be given them on lease all or part of the
 property of the grouping, subject to the conditions laid down in Chapter VII of Title I of Book VI [Chapter VI of Title I of
 Book IV] of the Rural Code.
       In case of several requests, the property of the grouping may, where its composition so permits, be the subject of
 several leases benefiting different coheirs; otherwise, and failing an amicable agreement the court shall designate the
 lessee taking into account the fitness of the various applicants to manage the  property concerned and to remain therein.
 Where the terms and conditions of that lease or of those leases were not the subject of an agreement, they shall be
 fixed by the court.
       The immovable property and rights which the applicants do not intend to contribute to the agricultural land grouping,
 together with the other property of the succession, shall be allotted by priority, within the limits of their respective rights

 of succession, to the undivided owners who did not agree to the formation of the grouping. Where those undivided
 owners do not obtain the whole of their rights through the allotment thus made, a balance must be paid to them. Unless
 otherwise amicably agreed between the coparceners, a balance which may be owed shall be paid within the year
 following the partition. It may be effected through a giving in payment under the form of shares in the agricultural land
 grouping, unless the parties concerned, within the month following the proposal made to them, make known their
 opposition to that mode of payment.
       Partition is complete only after the signature of the instrument of constitution of the agricultural land grouping and, if
 there is occasion, of the long-term lease or leases.
 Art. 832-3
 (Act no 80-502 of 4 July 1980)
       Where an agricultural holding constituting an economic unit and not operated under the form of a partnership is not
 maintained in undivided ownership under Articles 815, paragraph 2, and 815-1, and was not the subject of a preferential
 allotment within the terms provided for in Articles 832, 832-1 or 832-2, a surviving spouse or any co-owner heir who
 wishes to continue the exploiting in which he or she actually participates or participated may require, notwithstanding
 any request for auction, that the partition be concluded subject to the condition that his or her coparceners grant to him
 or her a long-term lease under the terms fixed in Chapter VII of Title I of Book VI [Chapter VI of Title I of Book IV] of the
 Rural Code, on the lands of the holding which fall to them. Unless otherwise amicably agreed between the parties, the
 one who requests to benefit by those provisions shall receive by priority in his or her share the buildings for exploitation
 and habitation.
       The preceding provisions shall apply to a part of an agricultural holding which can constitute an economic unit.
       Account shall be taken, if there is occasion, of depreciation due to the existence of a lease in the appraisal of the
 lands included in the various shares.
       Articles 807 and 808 [L. 412-14 and L. 412-15] of the Rural Code shall determine the specific rules for the lease
 referred to in the first paragraph of this Article.
       Where there are several requests, the tribunal de grande instance shall designate the beneficiary or beneficiaries on
 the basis of the interests as they stand and of the fitness of the various applicants to manage all or part of the holding or
 to remain therein.
       Where, due to the obvious unfitness of the applicant or applicants to manage all or part of the holding, the interests
 of the coheirs risk being imperilled, the court may decide that there is no occasion to apply the first three paragraphs of
 this Article.
       An economic unit referred to in paragraph 1 can be formed in part of property of which a surviving spouse or a heir
 was already owner or co-owner before the death. As regards a heir, the requisite of participation may have been fulfilled
 by his or her spouse.
 Art. 832-4
 (Act no 80-502 of 4 July 1980)
       The provisions of Articles 832, 832-1, 832-2 and 832-3 shall benefit a spouse or any heir, whether co-owner in full
 or bare ownership.
       The provisions of Articles 832, 832-2 and 832-3 shall benefit also a beneficiary, universal or by universal title, of the
 succession by virtue of a will or of a contractual institution.
 Art. 833
       Inequality of shares in kind shall be compensated by a reversion, either in the form of an annuity, or in money.
 Art. 833-1
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Where the debtor of a balance has obtained time for payment and, as a result of economic circumstances, the value
 of the property put in his share has increased or lessened by more than one-fourth since the partition, the sums
 remaining due shall increase or lessen in the same proportion.
       The parties may, however, agree that the amount of the balance will not vary.
 Art. 834
       Shares are made by one of the coheirs where they can agree between themselves on the choice and where the one
 chosen accepts the charge: otherwise the shares shall be made by an expert appointed by the supervising judge.
       They shall then be drawn by lots.
 Art. 835
       Before drawing the lots, each coparcener is allowed to present objections as to their formation.
 Art. 836
       The rules established for the division of the masses to be partitioned shall also be followed in the subdivision to be
 made between the coparcener stocks.
 Art. 837
       Where, in operations referred to a notaire, controversies arise, the notaire shall draw up a memorandum of the
 difficulties and respective statements of the parties, and shall refer them to the supervisor appointed for the partition;
 and as to other issues, proceedings shall be conducted as prescribed by legislation relating to procedure.

 Art. 838
 (Act no 64-1230 of 14 Dec. 1964)
       Where all coheirs are not present, a partition must be made in court, under the rules of Articles 819 to 837.
       It shall be the same where there are among them non-emancipated minors or adults in guardianship, subject to
 Article 466.
       Where there are several minors, a special and distinct guardian may be given to each of them.
 Art. 839
 (Act no 64-1230 of 14 Dec. 1964)
       Where there is occasion for an auction, in the case provided for in paragraph 1 of the preceding Article, it may be
 made only in court with the formalities prescribed for the transfer of the property of minors. Outsiders shall always be
 admitted.
 Art. 840
 (Act no 64-1230 of 14 Dec. 1964)
       Partitions made in accordance with the rules above prescribed in the name of"presumed absentees" (Act no
 77-1447 of 28 Dec. 1977) and persons not present are final; they are temporary only where the prescribed rules were
 not complied with.
 Art. 841
       [repealed]
 Art. 842
       After partition, each coparcener shall receive the instruments of title pertaining to the property which falls on him.
       Instruments of title of a divided property shall remain to the one who has the largest part, with the responsibility to
 assist with them those of his coparceners who have an interest therein, where he is required to do so.
       Instruments of title common to a whole inheritance shall be delivered to the one whom all the heirs have chosen to
 be the depositary of them, with the responsibility to assist the coparceners with them, whenever required. Where there is
 a difficulty about that choice, it shall be regulated by the judge.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Collations, Appropriation and Abatement of Gratuitous Transfers Made
 to Persons Entitled to Inherit
 Art. 843
 (Act of 24 March 1898)
 Articles 843 to 869
       Every heir, even beneficiary, coming into a succession, shall return to his coheirs everything he has received from
 the deceased, by gift inter vivos, directly or indirectly; he may not keep the gifts made to him by the deceased unless
 they were made expressly over and above his share, or with exemption from collation.
       Legacies made to a heir are deemed to be made over and above his part, unless the testator has expressed his
 wish to the contrary, in which case the legatee may only claim his legacy by taking less.
 Art. 844
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Gifts made over and above the share or with exemption from collation may be retained, and legacies may be
 claimed by an heir coming into a partition, only up to the amount of the disposable portion: the excess is subject to
 reduction.
 Art. 845
       An heir who renounces a succession may nevertheless retain the gift inter vivos or claim the legacy made to him up
 to the amount of the disposable portion.
 Art. 846
       A donee who was not a presumptive heir at the time of the gift, but who is entitled to inherit on the day of the
 opening of the succession, is also bound to collation, unless the donor has exempted him from it.
 Art. 847
       Gifts and legacies made to the son of a person who is entitled to inherit at the time of the opening of the succession,
 are always deemed to have been made with exemption from collation.
       The father coming  to the succession of the donor is not bound to collate them.
 Art. 848
       Likewise, a son coming in his own right to the succession of the donor is not bound to collate a gift made to his
 father, even if he has accepted the latter's succession; but where the son comes only by representation, he shall collate
 what was given to his father, even in the case where he has repudiated his succession.
 Art. 849
       Gifts and legacies made to the spouse of a spouse entitled to inherit are deemed to be made with exemption from
 collation.
       Where gifts and legacies are made jointly to two spouses, one of whom only inherits, the latter collates the half;
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 122/268
CIVIL CODE
 where the gifts are made to the spouse entitled to inherit, he or she shall collate the whole.
 Art. 850
       Collation is made only to the succession of the donor.
 Art. 851
       Collation is due for what has been devoted to the settling of one of the coheirs, or for the payment of his debts.
 Art. 852
       The expenses of food, support, education, apprenticeship, the ordinary costs of outfitting, those of weddings and
 usual presents, shall not be collated.
 Art. 853
       It shall be the same with profits which a heir may have made out of agreements entered into with the deceased,
 where those agreements did not offer any indirect advantage when they were made.
 Art. 854
       Likewise, no collation is due for partnerships concluded without fraud between the deceased and one of his heirs,
 where the articles thereof were regulated by an authentic instrument.
 Art. 855
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       A property which perishes through a fortuitous event and without fault of the donee is not subject to collation.
       Where, however, that property was restored through an indemnity received because of its loss, a donee shall collate
 it in the proportion that the indemnity served to restore it.
       Where the indemnity was not used for that purpose, it is itself subject to collation.
 Art. 856
       Fruits and interests from things subject to collation are due only from the day of the opening of the succession.
 Art. 857
       Collation is only due by a coheir to his coheir; it is not due to legatees nor to creditors of the succession.
 Art. 858
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Collation is made by taking less. It may not be required in kind unless otherwise stipulated in the instrument of gift.
       In case of such a stipulation, conveyances and creations of real rights granted by the donee are extinguished in
 consequence of collation, unless the donor has consented to them.
 Art. 859
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       An heir also has the power to collate in kind property given which still belongs to him provided that property be free
 from any encumbrance or occupancy with which it was not already burdened at the time of the gift.
 Art. 860
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Collation is due of the value of the property given at the time of partition, according to its condition at the time of the
 gift.
       Where the property was transferred before partition, account shall be taken of the value it had at the time of transfer
 and, where a new property was substituted for the property transferred, of the value of that new property at the time of
 partition.
       The whole, unless otherwise stipulated in the instrument of gift.
       Where it results from such a stipulation that the value to be collated is less than the value of the property
 determined according to the rules of appraisal provided for by Article 922 below, that difference forms an indirect
 advantage vested in the donee over and above his share.
 Art. 861
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Where collation is made in kind and the condition of the property given was improved by the act of the donee,
 account thereof must be taken to him, in consideration of that by which their value has increased at the time of partition
 or transfer.
       Likewise account must be taken to the donee of the necessary expenses which he made for the preservation of the
 property, even if they have not improved it.
 Art. 862
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       A coheir who makes collation in kind may retain possession of the property given until the sums due to him for
 expenses or improvements have been actually reimbursed.
 Art. 863
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       A donee, on his part, must, in case of collation in kind, account for degradations and deteriorations which have
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 123/268
CIVIL CODE
 reduced the value of the property given through his act or fault.
 Art. 864
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       A gift made in advance of his share to a compulsory heir who accepts the succession shall be appropriated to his
 share of reserve and, subsidiarily to the disposable portion, unless otherwise agreed in the instrument of gift.
       The excess is subject to abatement.
       A gift made in advance of his share to a compulsory heir who renounces the succession is treated as a gift over and
 above the donee's share.
 Art. 865
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       A gratuitous transfer made over and above the beneficiary's share shall be appropriated to the disposable portion.
 The excess is subject to abatement.
 Art. 866
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Gifts made to a person entitled to inherit, or to persons entitled to inherit, jointly, which exceed the disposable
 portion may be retained in whole by the beneficiaries, whatever the excess may be, provided they compensate the
 coheirs in money.
 Art. 867
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Where a legacy made to a person entitled to inherit, or to persons entitled to inherit, jointly, relates to a property or
 several items of property which compose a whole whose value exceeds the disposable portion, the legatee or legatees
 may, whatever the excess, claim in totality the subject matter of the gratuitous transfer, provided they compensate the
 coheirs in money. It shall be likewise even where the gratuitous transfer involves movable items of property which were
 in the common use of the deceased and of the legatee.
 Art. 868
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Where abatement may not be required in kind, a donee or legatee is debtor for an indemnity equivalent to the
 excess portion of the abatable gratuitous transfer. That indemnity shall be calculated according to the value of the
 articles donated or bequeathed at the time of partition, and their condition on the day when the gratuitous transfer took
 effect.
       It is payable at the time of partition, save agreement between the coheirs. However, where the subject matter of the
 gratuitous transfer is an item of the property which may be the subject of a preferential allotment, periods may be
 granted by the court, account being taken of the interests as they stand, if they were not granted by the transferor. The
 granting of those periods may not in any case have the effect of deferring payment of the indemnity beyond ten years
 from the opening of the succession. The provisions of Article 833-1 shall then apply to the payment of the sums due.
       Failing agreement or stipulation to the contrary, those sums bear interests at the statutory rate in civil matters.
 Advantages resulting from periods and methods of payment granted do not constitute a gratuitous transfer.
       In case of sale of the whole of a property donated or bequeathed, the sums remaining due become immediately
 due; in case of partial sales, the proceeds of those sales are paid to the coheirs and appropriated to the sums still due.
 Art. 869
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Collation of a sum of money is equal to its amount. Where, however, it was used to acquire property, collation of the
 value of that property is due, in the way provided for in Article 860.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Payment of Debts
 Art. 870
 Articles 870 to 882
       Coheirs contribute between themselves to the payment of the debts and liabilities of the succession, each one in
 proportion to what he takes from it.
 Art. 871
       A legatee under universal title contributes with the heirs pro rata to his benefit; but a specific legatee is not held for
 the debts and liabilities, except however a foreclosure action against a bequeathed immovable.
 Art. 872
       Where immovables of a succession are encumbered by annuities with a special mortgage, each  coheir may require
 that the annuities be reimbursed and the immovables freed before the composing of the shares. Where the coheirs
 partition the succession in the condition in which it stands, the encumbered immovable must be appraised at the same
 rate as the other immovables; the capital of the annuity shall be deducted from the total value; the heir in whose share
 that immovable falls has alone the charge of servicing the annuity and is liable for it towards his coheirs.
 Art. 873
       Heirs are held to the debts and liabilities of the succession personally for their equal share and portion, and by
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 124/268
CIVIL CODE
 mortgage for the whole; subject to their remedy either against their coheirs, or against the universal legatees, for the part
 to which the latter must contribute.
 Art. 874
       A specific legatee who has paid a debt encumbering a bequeathed immovable remains subrogated to the rights of
 the creditor against the heirs and successors under universal title.
 Art. 875
       A coheir or successor under universal title who, because of a mortgage, has paid more than his share of a common
 debt, has a remedy against the other heirs or successors under universal title only for the share which each of them
 must bear personally, even in the case where the coheir who paid the debt has caused himself to be subrogated to the
 rights of the creditor; without prejudice, however, of the rights of a coheir who, because of benefit of inventory, has
 retained the power to demand payment of his personal claim, like any other creditor.
 Art. 876
       In case of insolvency of one of the coheirs or successors under universal title, his share of the mortgage debt must
 be divided pro rata between all the others.
 Art. 877
       Enforceable instruments against a deceased are equally enforceable against a heir personally; creditors, however,
 may seek enforcement only eight days after notice of those instruments has been served upon the heir personally or at
 his domicile.
 Art. 878
       They may request, in any case and against any creditor, separation of the deceased's patrimony from the heir's
 patrimony.
 Art. 879
       That right, however, may no longer be exercised where there is novation in the claim against the deceased, by
 acceptance of the heir as debtor.
 Art. 880
       It is time-barred, with regard to movables, after the lapse of three years.
       With regard to immovables, an action may be brought as long as they are in the hands of the heir.
 Art. 881
       Creditors of an heir are not allowed to request the separation of the patrimonies against the creditors of the
 succession.
 Art. 882
       In order to prevent that partition be made in fraud of their rights, creditors of a coparcener may oppose its being
 made out of their presence; they have the right to intervene in it at their own expense; but they may not attack a partition
 achieved, unless, however, it was made without them and notwithstanding an objection they would have made.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of the Effects of Partition and of Warranty of Shares
 Art. 883
 (Act no 76-1286 of 31 Dec. 1976)
 Articles 883 to 886
       Each coheir shall be deemed to have succeeded alone and immediately to all the effects comprised in his share, or
 falling to him through auction, and never to have had ownership of the other effects of the succession.
       It shall be the same as to the property which came to him through any other act leading to the cessation of
 undivided ownership. One shall not distinguish depending on whether the act causes undivided ownership to cease in
 whole or in part, with regard only to some items of property or to some heirs.
       However, transactions lawfully performed either under an agency given by the coheirs, or under a judicial
 authorization, maintain their effects whatever the allotment of the property which was the subject thereof may be at the
 time of the partition.
 Art. 884
       Coheirs remain respectively warrantors towards each other only for disturbances and dispossession which result
 from a cause previous to the partition.
       The warranty may not arise where the kind of dispossession suffered was excepted by a specific and express
 clause of the instrument of partition; it ceases where a heir suffers dispossession by his own fault.
 Art. 885
       Each coheir is personally obliged in proportion to his hereditary share to indemnify his coheir for the loss which
 dispossession caused to him.
       Where one of the coheirs is insolvent, the portion for which he is responsible must be equally divided between the
 warrantor and all the solvent coheirs.
 Art. 886
       The warranty of solvency of the debtor of an annuity may be enforced only within the five years following the

 partition. Warranty on account of insolvency does not arise where it happened only since the partition achieved.
                        SECTION V
                        Of Rescission in Matters of Partition
 Art. 887
       Partitions may be rescinded for reason of violence or deception.
 Articles 887 to 892
       There may also be occasion for rescission where one of the coheirs establishes, to his prejudice, loss amounting to
 more than one fourth. The mere omission of an article of the succession does not give rise to an action for rescission,
 but only to a supplement to the instrument of partition.
 Art. 888
       An action for partition is allowed against any act aiming at putting an end to an undivided ownership, between
 coheirs, whether it be characterized as a sale, exchange, settlement, or in  any other manner.
       But, after the partition, or the act which takes its place, an action for rescission is no longer admissible against a
 settlement made over the real difficulties which the first act presented, even though no suit has been initiated on that
 subject.
 Art. 889
       An action is not admitted against a sale of rights to succession made without fraud to one of the coheirs, at his own
 risk, by his other coheirs or one of them.
 Art. 890
       In order to decide whether there has been loss, the articles shall be appraised according to their value at the time of
 partition.
 Art. 891
       The defendant in a claim for rescission may stop the course of it and prevent a new partition by offering and
 delivering to the plaintiff the supplement of his hereditary share, either in money, or in kind.
 Art. 892
       A coheir who has transferred his share in whole or in part, is no longer entitled to bring an action for rescission on
 ground of deception or violence, where the transfer which he made is subsequent to the discovery of the deception, or to
 the ending of the violence.
        TITLE II
        OF GIFTS INTER  VIVOS AND OF WILLS
                CHAPTER I
                General Provisions
 Art. 893
 Articles 893 to 1100
 Articles 893 to 900-8
       One may dispose of his property gratuitously only by gift inter vivos or by will, in the forms hereinafter laid down.
 Art. 894
       A gift inter vivos is a transaction by which the donor divests himself now and irrevocably of the thing donated, in
 favour of the donee who accepts it.
 Art. 895
       A will is a transaction by which a testator disposes, for the time when he is no longer alive, of the whole or part of
 his property, and which he may revoke.
 Art. 896
       Substitutions are prohibited.
       Any disposition by which a donee, an heir appointed or a legatee, is assigned the duty to keep and return to a third
 party, is void, even with regard to the donee, the heir appointed or the legatee.
       [repealed]
 Art. 897
       Are excepted from the first two paragraphs of the preceding Article the dispositions which the fathers and mothers
 and the brothers and sisters are allowed to make under Chapter VI of this Title.
 Art. 898
       A disposition by which a third party is called to take a gift, an inheritance or a legacy, in case a donee, an heir
 appointed or a legatee would not take it, shall not be considered as a substitution, and is valid.
 Art. 899
       It shall be the same as regards an inter vivos or testamentary disposition by which a usufruct is donated to one
 person and bare ownership to another.
 Art. 900
       In any inter vivos or testamentary disposition, the conditions which are impossible or those which are contrary to
 legislation or good morals, shall be deemed to be not written.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 900-1
 (Act no 71-526 of 3 July 1971)
       Clauses of inalienability concerning a property donated or bequeathed are valid only where they are temporary and
 justified by a serious and legitimate interest. Even in that case, a donee or legatee may be judicially authorized to
 dispose of the property if the interest which justified the clause has disappeared or if it happens that a more important
 interest so requires.
       [repealed]
       The provisions of this Article do not prejudice gratuitous transfers granted to juridical persons or even to natural
 persons responsible for forming juridical persons.
 Art. 900-2
 (Act no 84-562 of 4 July 1984)
       A beneficiary may apply for judicial revision of the conditions and charges encumbering the gifts or legacies which
 he has received, where, in consequence of a change of circumstances, performance of them has become for him
 extremely difficult, or seriously detrimental.
 Art. 900-3
 (Act no 84-562 of 4 July 1984)
       A claim for revision shall be  brought as a main action; it may be so also as a counterclaim, in reply to an action for
 performance or revocation brought by the heirs of the disposing person.
       It shall be brought against the heirs; it shall be brought at the same time against the Government procurator's office
 where there is doubt as to the existence or identity of some of them; where there is no known heir, it must be brought
 against the Government procurator's office.
       The latter shall, in any case, have the case communicated to him.
 Art. 900-4
 (Act no 84-562 of 4 July 1984)
       A judge seized of a claim for revision may, according to the circumstances and even of his own motion, either
 reduce the quantity or intervals of the performances encumbering the gratuitous transfer, or modify their character
 making allowance for the intention of the disposing person, or even merge them with analogous performances resulting
 from other gratuitous transfers.
       He may authorize the transfer of all or part of the property which is the subject matter of the gratuitous transfer with
 ordering that the proceeds thereof be used for purposes in keeping with the intention of the disposing  party.
       He shall prescribe measures adapted to maintain, as far as possible, the denomination which the disposing person
 intended to give to his gratuitous transfer.
 Art. 900-5
 (Act no 84-562 of 4 July 1984)
       A claim is admissible only ten years after the death of the disposing person or, in case of a succession of claims,
 ten years after the judgment which ordered the previous revision.
       A beneficiary must justify the steps he took, during the interval, to perform his obligations.
 Art. 900-6
 (Act no 84-562 of 4 July 1984)
       Third party application for rehearing against a judgment acceding to an application for revision is admissible only in
 case of fraud chargeable to the donee or legatee.
       The retraction or reformation of the judgment attacked does not give rise to any action against the third party
 purchaser in good faith.
 Art. 900-7
 (Act no 84-562 of 4 July 1984)
       Where, after revision, performance of the conditions or charges, such as it was originally provided, becomes
 possible again, it may be requested by the heirs.
 Art. 900-8
 (Act no 84-562 of 4 July 1984)
       Shall be deemed not written any clause by which a disposing party deprives of a gratuitous transfer a person who
 questions the validity of a clause of inalienability or requests authorization to transfer.
                CHAPTER II
                Of the Capacity to Dispose or to Receive by Inter Vivos Gift or by Will
 Art. 901
       To make an inter vivos gift or a will one must be of sound mind.
 Art. 902
 Articles 901 to 912
       All persons may dispose and receive, either by inter vivos gift, or by will, except those whom legislation declares to
 be incapable.
 Art. 903
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 127/268
CIVIL CODE
       A minor under sixteen years of age may not in any way dispose, except for what is provided for in Chapter IX of this
 Title.
 Art. 904
 (Act no 64-1230 of 14 Dec. 1964)
       A minor who has reached the age of sixteen years and is not emancipated, may only dispose by will, and only to the
 extent of half of the property which legislation allows an adult to dispose of.
       (Act of 28 Oct. 1916) Where, however, he is called up for a campaign of war, he may, during the duration of the
 hostilities, dispose of the same portion as if he were of full age, in favour of any of his relatives, or of several of them up
 to the sixth degree inclusive or in favour of his surviving spouse.
       Failing relatives of the sixth degree inclusive, a minor may dispose as a person of full age would do.
 Art. 905
       [repealed]
 Art. 906
       To be capable of receiving inter vivos, one need only to be conceived at the time of the gift.
       To be capable of receiving by will, one need only to be conceived at the time of the death of the testator.
       However, the gift or will may only take effect if the child is born viable.
 Art. 907
       A minor, although he has reached the age of sixteen, may not dispose to the benefit of his guardian, even by will.
       (Act no 64-1230 of 14 Dec. 1964) A minor, having become of age or emancipated, may not dispose, either by gift
 inter vivos or by will, to the benefit of the person who was his guardian, unless the final account of the guardianship has
 been previously rendered and audited.
       In the above two cases, the ascendants of minors who are or who were their guardians are excepted.
 Art. 908 and 908-1
       [repealed]
 Art. 908-2
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       In inter vivos and testamentary dispositions, the phrases"sons and grandsons, children and grandchildren", without
 other addition or designation, refer to illegitimate descent as well as legitimate, unless the contrary results from the
 instrument or from circumstances.
 Art. 909
       Doctors in medicine or surgery, health officers and pharmacists who have treated a person during the disease of
 which he dies, may not benefit from the inter vivos or testamentary dispositions which he made in their favour during the
 course of that illness.
       Are excepted :
       1° Specific remunerative dispositions, with regard to the means of the disposing party and to the services rendered; 
       2° Universal dispositions, in the case of relationship up to the fourth degree inclusive, provided however the
 deceased has no heir in the direct line; unless the person in whose favour the disposition was made is himself one of
 those heirs.
       The same rules shall apply to ministers of worship.
 Art. 910
       Dispositions inter vivos or by will to the benefit of almshouses, of the poor of a commune or of public-utility
 institutions may only take effect as they are authorized by decree.
       (Ord. no 2005-856 of 28 July 2005) However the dispositions inter vivos or by will to the benefit of foundations,
 congregations and partnerships having the capacity to receive gratuities, except the partnerships or foundations whose
 activities and those of their managers are referred to in Article 1 of the Act of 12 June 2001 to Strengthen Prevention
 and Punishment of Sectarian Organizations which Interfere with Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, may be
 accepted freely by them, except if there is an objection justified by the incapacity of the legatee or donee institution for
 making use of the gratuitous transfer in accordance with its statutory purpose. The objection is raised by the
 administrative authority to which the gratuitous transfer is declared, in the way provided for by a decree in Conseil d'Etat.
 The objection shall deprive the acceptance of effect.
 Art. 911
       Any disposition in favour of a person under a disability is void, whether it is disguised under the form of a contract
 for value, or is made under the names of intermediaries.
       Are deemed intermediaries the father and mother, the children and descendants, and the spouse of the person
 under a disability.
 Art. 912

                CHAPTER III
                Of the Disposable Portion of Property and of Abatement
 Articles 913 to 930
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 128/268
CIVIL CODE
                        SECTION I
 Articles 913 to 919
                        Of the Disposable Portion of  Property
 Art. 913
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       Gratuitous transfers, either by inter vivos acts or by wills, may not exceed half of the property of a disposing person,
 where he leaves only one child at his death; one-third, where he leaves two children; one-fourth, where he leaves three
 or a greater number.[...]
 Art. 913-1
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       Are included in Article 913, under the name of children, descendants in whatever degree, although they must be
 counted only for the child whose place they take in the succession of the disposing party.
 Art. 914
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       Gratuitous transfers, either by inter vivos acts or by wills, may not exceed half of the property where, failing children,
 a deceased leaves one or several ascendants in each of the lines, paternal and maternal, and three-fourths where he
 leaves ascendants only in one line.
       The property thus reserved for the benefit of ascendants is received by them in the order that the law calls them to
 succeed: they alone are entitled to that reserve in all cases where a partition concurrently with collaterals would not give
 them the portion of property assigned to it.
 Art. 914-1
 (Act no 2001-1135 of 3 Dec. 2001)
       Gratuitous transfers, either by inter vivos acts or by wills, may not exceed three-fourths of the property where, failing
 descendants and ascendants, a deceased leaves a surviving spouse, not divorced, against whom does not exist an
 order of judicial separation become res judicata  and who is not a party to divorce or judicial separation proceedings.
 Art. 915 to 915-2
       [repealed]
 Art. 916
       "Failing descendants, ascendants or a surviving spouse, not divorced, against whom an order of judicial separation
 become res judicata  does not exist and who is not a party to divorce or judicial separation proceedings" (Act no
 2001-1135 of 3 Dec. 2001), gratuitous transfers by inter vivos acts or by wills may exhaust the whole property.
 Art. 917
       Where a disposition by inter vivos act or by will is of a usufruct or of an annuity whose value exceeds the disposable
 portion, the heirs for whose benefit the law establishes a reserve have the option, either to perform that disposition or to
 waive ownership of the disposable portion.
 Art. 918
       The value in full ownership of property transferred, either on condition of paying a life annuity, or non-returnable, or
 with reservation of a usufruct, to one of the persons entitled to inherit in the direct line, shall be appropriated to the
 disposable portion; and the excess, if any, shall be collated to the mass. That appropriation and that collation may not be
 requested by those of the other persons entitled to inherit in the direct line who may have consented to those transfers,
 and, in no case, by persons entitled to inherit in the collateral line.
 Art. 919
 (Act of 24 March 1898)
       The disposable portion may be donated in whole or in part, either by act inter vivos or by will, to the children or other
 persons entitled to inherit from the donor, without being subject to collation by the donee or legatee coming to the
 succession, provided that, as regards gifts, the disposition was made expressly over and above the share.
       A declaration that a gift is over and above the share may be made, either in the instrument containing the
 disposition, or after, in the form of inter vivos or testamentary dispositions.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Abatement of Gifts and Legacies
 Art. 920
 Articles 920 to 930
       Dispositions either inter vivos or mortis causa, which exceed the disposable portion shall be abated to that portion at
 the time of the opening of the succession.
 Art. 921
       Abatement of dispositions inter vivos may be requested only by those for whose benefit the law makes a reserve, by
 their heirs or assigns: donees, legatees or creditors of a deceased may not request that abatement or benefit by it.
 Art. 922
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Abatement is determined by forming a mass of all the property existing at the death of the donor or testator.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 129/268
CIVIL CODE
       One shall add fictitiously to it, after deducting the debts, that of which he has disposed by gift inter vivos according
 to its condition at the time of the gift and its value at the opening of the succession. Where property has been
 transferred, account shall be taken of its value at the time of transfer and, if there was substitution, of the value of the
 new property on the day of the opening of the succession.
       One shall calculate on all that property, having regard to the kind of heirs whom he leaves, the portion which the
 deceased may have disposed of.
 Art. 923
       There shall never be occasion to abate gifts inter vivos, until the value of all the property included in the
 testamentary dispositions has been exhausted; and where there is occasion for that abatement it shall be done
 beginning with the last gift and so on, going back from the last to the oldest.
 Art. 924
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       A compulsory heir favoured over and above his share beyond the disposable portion and who accepts the
 succession bears the abatement in value as is laid down in Article 866; up to his rights in the reserve, abatement shall
 be made by taking less.
       He may claim all the articles bequeathed where the reducible portion does not exceed his share in the reserve.
 Art. 925
       Where the value of the inter vivos gifts exceeds or equals the disposable portion, all the testamentary dispositions
 lapse.
 Art. 926
       Where the testamentary dispositions exceed, either the disposable portion, or that part of the portion remaining after
 deduction of the value of the inter vivos gifts, abatement shall be made pro rata, without any distinction between
 universal legacies and specific legacies.
 Art. 927
       Nevertheless, in all cases where the testator expressly declared that he intends that a legacy be paid in preference
 to others, that preference must take place: and the legacy to which it applies shall be abated only where the value of the
 others does not complete the statutory reserve.
 Art. 928
       A donee shall return the fruits of what exceeds the disposable portion from the day of the death of the donor, where
 a claim for abatement was brought within the year; otherwise, from the day of the claim.
 Art. 929
 (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971)
       Rights in rem created by a donee are extinguished by the effect of abatement. Those rights, however, maintain their
 effects where the donor consented to them in the constitutive instrument or in a subsequent instrument. The donee is
 responsible for depreciation resulting from it.
 Art. 930
       An action for abatement or recovery may be brought by the heirs against third parties holding immovables which
 were part of gifts and were conveyed by the donees, in the same manner and in the same order as against the donees
 themselves, and after attachment or seizure and sale of their property. That action must be brought following the order
 of the dates of the conveyances, beginning by the most recent.
       (Act no 71-523 of 3 July 1971) Where a donor has consented to the transfer with the accord of all compulsory heirs
 born and alive at the time of it, an action may no longer be brought against a third party holder.
                CHAPTER IV
                Of Inter Vivos Gifts
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Form of Inter Vivos Gifts
 Art. 931
 Articles 931 to 966
 Articles 931 to 952
       All acts containing an inter vivos gift shall be executed before  notaires, in the ordinary form of contracts; and there
 shall remain the original of them, on pain of annulment.
 Art. 932
       An inter vivos gift is binding upon the donor and produces effect only from the day when it is accepted in express
 terms.
       Acceptance may be made during the lifetime of the donor, by a subsequent and authentic instrument of which the
 original shall remain; but then the gift has effect, with regard to the donor, only from the day when he has been given
 notice of the instrument which establishes that acceptance.
 Art. 933
       Where the donor is of full age, acceptance must be made by him or in his name, by a person having a power of
 attorney, containing authority to accept the gift made, or a general authority to accept all gifts which have or may have
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 130/268
CIVIL CODE
 been made.
       That power of attorney must be executed before notaires; and an office copy of it must be annexed to the original of
 the gift, or to the original of the acceptance , if made by a separate instrument.
 Art. 934
       [repealed]
 Art. 935
       A gift made to a non-emancipated minor or to an adult in guardianship must be accepted by his guardian, in
 accordance with Article 463, in the Title Of Minority, of Guardianship and of Emancipation.
       [repealed]
       (Act no 64-1230 of 14 Dec. 1964) Nevertheless, the father and mother of a non-emancipated minor, or the other
 ascendants, even during the lifetime of the father and mother, although they are not guardians of the minor, may accept
 on his behalf.
 Art. 936
       A deaf and dumb person who knows how to write may accept by himself or through an agent.
       Where he cannot write, acceptance must be made by a curator appointed for that purpose, according to the rules
 laid down in the Title Of Minority, of Guardianship and of Emancipation.
 Art. 937
       Gifts made to the benefit of almshouses, of the poor of a commune or "subject to the provisions of Article 910,
 paragraph 2" (Ord. no 2005-856 of 28 July 2005), of public-utility institutions must be accepted by the administrators of
 those communes or institutions, after they have been duly authorized.
 Art. 938
       A gift duly accepted is complete by the sole consent of the parties; and ownership of the articles donated is
 transferred to the donee without need of any other delivery.
 Art. 939
 (Ord. no 59-71 of 7 Jan. 1959)
       Where there is a gift of property capable of being mortgaged, registration of the instruments containing the gift and
 the acceptance, as well as the notice of acceptance, if it took place by separate instrument, must be made at the land
 registry in the arrondissement  where the property is situated.
 Art. 940
       [repealed]
       Where a gift is made to minors, to adults in guardianship, or to public institutions, registration shall be made at the
 suit of guardians, curators or administrators.
 Art. 941
 (Ord. no 59-71 of 7 Jan. 1959)
       Failure to have the registration made may be set up by all interested persons, except, however, those who are
 responsible for having the registration made, or their assigns, and the donor.
 Art. 942
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Minors and adults in guardianship shall not be reinstated in case of failure to accept or register the gifts; subject to
 their remedy against their guardians, if there is occasion, and without reinstatement taking place, even where the
 guardians are insolvent.
 Art. 943
       An inter vivos gift may only include the existing property of the donor; where it includes property to come, it is void in
 this regard.
 Art. 944
       Any inter vivos gift made subject to conditions whose performance depends on the sole intention of the donor, is
 void.
 Art. 945
       It is likewise void where it was made under the condition of paying debts or liability other than those which existed at
 the time of the gift, or which are expressed either in the instrument of gift, or in a statement which should be annexed
 thereto.
 Art. 946
       In the case where the donor has reserved to himself the freedom to dispose of an article included in the gift, or of a
 fixed sum out of the property donated, if he dies without having disposed of them, the said article or sum shall belong to
 the donor's heirs, notwithstanding all clauses and stipulations to the contrary.
 Art. 947
       The four preceding Articles shall not apply to the gifts mentioned in Chapters VIII and IX of this Title.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 131/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 948
       Any act of gift of movable effects is valid only as to the effects of which a statement of appraisal, signed by the
 donor and the donee, or by those who accept for the latter, is annexed to the original of the gift.
 Art. 949
       A donor is allowed to reserve for his benefit or to dispose for the benefit of another, of the enjoyment or the usufruct
 of the movable or immovable property donated.
 Art. 950
       Where a gift of movable effects is made with reservation of usufruct, the donee is obliged, at the expiry of the
 usufruct, to take the effects donated which are in kind, in the condition in which they are; and he has an action against
 the donor or his heirs on account of the articles which do not exist, up to the amount of the value which was given to
 them in the statement of appraisal.
 Art. 951
       A donor may stipulate a right of reversion of the items donated, either for the case of the predecease of the donee
 alone, or for the case of the predecease of the donee and of his descendants;
       That right may be stipulated only for the benefit of the donor alone.
 Art. 952
       The effect of the right of reversion is to rescind all conveyances of the immovable property donated, and to make
 the property revert to the donor, free and unencumbered by any liabilities and mortgages, except, however, the
 mortgage of dowry and of ante-nuptial agreements, where the other property of the donor spouse is not sufficient and
 only in the case where the gift was made by the same ante-nuptial agreement from which those rights and mortgages
 result.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Exceptions to the Rule of  Irrevocability of  Inter Vivos Gifts
 Art. 953
 Articles 953 to 966
       An inter vivos gift may be revoked only for non-performance of the conditions under which it was made, on account
 of ingratitude, and on account of unforeseen birth of children.
 Art. 954
       In the case of revocation for non-performance of the conditions, the property shall revert to the hands of the donor
 free of all charges and mortgages granted by the donee: and the donor shall have the same rights against third parties
 holding the immovables donated as he would have against the donee himself.
 Art. 955
       An inter vivos gift may be revoked on account of ingratitude only in the following cases:
       1° Where the donee has made an attempt against the life of the donor;
       2° Where he has been guilty of cruelty, serious offences or grievous insults against him;
       3° Where he refuses maintenance to him.
 Art. 956
       Revocation on account of non-performance of conditions or of ingratitude may never take place by operation of law.
 Art. 957
       A claim for revocation on account of ingratitude must be brought within the year, from the day of the offence with
 which the donee is charged by the donor, or from the day when the offence could have been known by the donor.
       That revocation may not be applied for by the donor against the heirs of the donee, or by the heirs of the donor
 against the donee, unless, in the latter case, the action has been initiated by the donor, or he has died within a year after
 the offence.
 Art. 958
 (Ord. no 59-71 of 7 Jan. 1959)
       A revocation on account of ingratitude may not prejudice transfers made by a donee, or mortgages and other real
 encumbrances with which he may have burdened the subject matter of the gift, provided they all are previous to the
 registration of the claim for revocation at the land registry of the place of the property.
       In case of revocation, the donee shall be ordered to return the value of the articles transferred, with regard to the
 time of the claim, and the fruits, from the day of that claim.
 Art. 959
       Gifts in favour of marriage may not be revoked on account of ingratitude.
 Art. 960
       All inter vivos gifts made by persons who had no children or descendants presently living at the time of the gift, of
 whatever value they may be, and for whatever reason they may have been made, and although they were reciprocal or
 remunerative, even those made in favour of marriage by persons other than the ascendants to the spouses, or by the
 spouses to each other, are revoked by operation of law by the unforeseen birth of a "child of the donor, even
 posthumous" (Ord. no 2005-856 of 28 July 2005), or by legitimation by subsequent marriage of an illegitimate child,
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 132/268
CIVIL CODE
 where he was born after the gift.
 Art. 961
       That revocation shall take place, although the child of the donor was conceived at the time of the gift.
 Art. 962
       A gift is likewise revoked even if the donee has taken possession of the property donated and the latter has been
 left with him by the donor after the birth of the child; without, however, the donee being obliged to return the fruits
 collected by him, of whatever nature they may be, before the day when notice of the birth of the child [...] was served on
 him by process or other instrument in due form; and even where the claim for recovering the property donated was
 brought only after that notice.
 Art. 963
       Property included in a gift revoked by operation of law, shall revert to the patrimony of the donor free from all
 encumbrances and mortgages granted by the donee, without there being appropriated, even subsidiarily, to the
 restitution of the dowry of the wife of that donee, to her recoveries or other ante-nuptial agreements; and that shall take
 place even though the gift was made in favour of the marriage of the donee and included in the agreement, and the
 donor has bound himself as surety, through the gift, for the performance of the ante-nuptial agreement.
 Art. 964
       Gifts revoked in this way may not be revived or resume their effect, either by the death of the donor's child, or by
 any confirmatory instrument; and where the donor wishes to donate the same property to the same donee, either before
 or after the death of the child through whose birth the gift was revoked, he may do so only by a new disposition.
 Art. 965
       Any clause or agreement by which a donor renounces the revocation of a gift on account of unforeseen birth of a
 child, shall be considered as void and may not produce any effect.
 Art. 966
       A donee, his heirs or assigns, or others detaining things donated, may set up prescription to assert a gift revoked by
 the unforeseen birth of a child only after a possession of thirty years, which may start running only from the day of the
 birth of the latest child of the donor, even posthumous; and without prejudice to interruptions, as provided by law.

 Art. 975
       Legatees, in whatever class they may be, their relatives by blood or marriage up to the fourth degree inclusive, or

 Art. 976
 (Act no 50-1513 of 8 Dec. 1950)
       Where a testator wishes to make a secret will, the paper which contains the dispositions or the paper used as an
 envelope, if there is one, shall be closed, stamped and sealed up.
       The testator shall present it thus closed, stamped and sealed up to the notaire and to two witnesses, or he will have
 it closed, stamped and sealed up in their presence and he shall declare that the contents of that paper is his will, signed
 by him, and written by him or by another, while affirming in that latter case, that he has personally verified its contents;
 he shall indicate, in all cases, the mode of writing used (by hand or mechanical).  
       The notary shall draw up, in original not recorded, an instrument of superscription which he shall write or have
 written by hand or mechanically on that paper, or on the sheet used as an envelop and bearing the date and indication
 of the place where it was done, a description of the cover and of the print of the seal, and mention of all the

 Art. 977
 (Act no 50-1513 of 8 Dec. 1950)

 that the will be signed by him and written by him or another, that he present it to the notaire and to the witnesses and
 that he write at the top of the instrument of superscription, in their presence, that the paper he presents is his will and
 sign. Mention shall be made in the instrument of superscription that the testator has written and signed those words in
 the presence of the notaire and of the witnesses and, furthermore, all which is prescribed by Article 976 and is not
 inconsistent with this Article shall be complied with.
       In all cases provided for in this Article and in the preceding Articles, a secret will in which the statutory formalities
 were not complied with and which is void as such, is valid however as a holographic will, where all the requisites for its
 validity as holographic will are fulfilled, even if it was named a secret will.

 Art. 1002
 Article 1002
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 136/268
CIVIL CODE
       Testamentary dispositions are either universal, or by universal title, or specific.
       Each of those dispositions, whether made under the designation of appointment of an heir, or made under the
 designation of legacy, produces its effect according to the rules hereafter laid down for universal legacies, for legacies
 by universal title, or for specific legacies.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Universal Legacies
 Art. 1003
 Articles 1003 to 1009
       A universal legacy is a testamentary disposition by which a testator donates to one or more persons the entirety of
 the property which he may leave at his death.
 Art. 1004
       Where, at the death of a testator, there are heirs to whom a portion of his property is reserved by law, those heirs
 are seized by operation of law, by the death, of all the property of the succession; and a universal legatee is compelled
 to request of them the delivery of the property included in the will.
 Art. 1005
       However, in the same cases, a universal legatee has the enjoyment of the property included in the will from the day
 of the death, where a claim for delivery was brought within one year after that time; otherwise, that enjoyment shall only
 commence from the day of a claim brought in court, or from the day when delivery was voluntarily agreed to.
 Art. 1006
       Where at the death of a testator there are no heirs to whom a portion of the property is reserved by law, a universal
 legatee is seized by operation of law by the death of the testator, without being compelled to request delivery.
 Art. 1007
 (Act no 66-1012 of 28 Dec. 1966)
       Before it produces its effects, an holographic or secret will shall be deposited in the hands of a notaire. The will shall
 be opened where it is sealed . The notaire shall draw up at once a memorandum of the opening and of the condition of
 the will, while specifying the circumstances of the deposit. The will as well as the memorandum shall take their place
 among the original records of the notaire.
       Within the month following the date of the memorandum, the notaire shall address an office copy of it and a
 facsimile of the will to the chief clerk of the tribunal d'instance of the place of opening of the succession, who shall
 acknowledge receipt of those documents and shall place them among his original records.
 Art. 1008
       In the case of Article 1006, where the will is holographic or secret, a universal legatee is bound to apply to be vested
 with possession, by an order of the president, written at the foot of a petition, to which the instrument of deposit shall be
 joined.
 Art. 1009
       A universal legatee who competes with an heir to whom the law reserves a portion of the property, is liable for the
 debts and charges of the succession of the testator, personally to the extent of his share and portion, and as to
 mortgages to the extent of the whole; and he is responsible for paying all the legacies, except in case of abatement, as
 is stated in Articles 926 and 927.
                        SECTION V
                        Of Legacies under Universal Title
 Art. 1010
 Articles 1010 to 1013
       A legacy under universal title is one by which the testator bequeaths a portion of the property of which the law
 permits him to dispose, such as a half, a third, or all his immovables, or all his movables, or a fixed portion of all his
 immovables or of all his movables.
       Any other legacy constitutes only a specific disposition.
 Art. 1011
       Legatees by universal title are obliged to request delivery from the heirs to whom a portion of property is reserved
 by law; and, failing them, from the heirs called in the order established by the Title Of Successions.
 Art. 1012
       A legatee by universal title is liable, like a universal legatee, for the debts and charges of the succession of the
 testator, personally to the extent of his share and portion, and as to mortgages to the extent of the whole.
 Art. 1013
       Where a testator has disposed of only a part of the disposable portion, and has done so by universal title, that
 legatee is responsible for paying the specific legacies pro rata with the natural heirs.
                        SECTION VI
                        Of Specific Legacies
 Art. 1014
 Articles 1014 to 1024
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 137/268
CIVIL CODE
       An outright legacy gives to the legatee, from the day of the death of the testator, a right to the thing bequeathed,
 which right may be transmitted to his heirs or assigns.
       Nevertheless, a specific legatee may be vested with the possession of the thing bequeathed, or claim the fruits or
 interests of it only from the day of his claim for delivery, made following the order established by Article 1011, or from the
 day when delivery was voluntarily granted to him.
 Art. 1015
       Interests or fruits of a thing bequeathed accrue to the legatee, from the day of the death, and without a claim having
 been brought by him in court:
       1° Where the testator has expressly expressed his wish in this regard in the will;
       2° Where an annuity or a pension has been bequeathed as a maintenance.
 Art. 1016
       The costs of a claim for delivery shall be charged to the succession, without however a reduction of the statutory
 reserve resulting from it.
       Recording fees are due by the legatee.
       All of which, unless otherwise directed by the will.
       Each legacy may be registered separately, without that registration benefiting to anyone other than the legatee or
 his assigns.
 Art. 1017
       The heirs of the testator, or other debtors for a legacy, are personally liable for its payment, each one pro rata of the
 share and portion by which he benefits in the succession.
       They are responsible as to mortgages for the whole, up to the amount of the value of the immovables of the
 succession which they may hold.
 Art. 1018
       The thing bequeathed shall be delivered with its necessary accessories, and in the condition in which it stands on
 the day of the death of the donor.
 Art. 1019
       Where a person who bequeathed ownership of an immovable, has increased it thereafter by acquisitions, those
 acquisitions, even if contiguous, shall not be deemed to form a part of the legacy, failing a new disposition.
       It may not be so of improvements or of new constructions made on the tenement bequeathed, or of an enclosure
 whose space the testator has increased.
 Art. 1020
       Where, before the will or afterwards, a thing bequeathed has been mortgaged for a debt of the succession, or even
 for the debt of a third person, or where it is burdened with a usufruct, the one who is obliged to pay the legacy is not
 bound to disencumber the thing, unless he has been directed to do so by an express provision of the testator.
 Art. 1021

 that the thing did not belong to him.
 Art. 1022

 offer it of the worst.
 Art. 1023
       A legacy made to a creditor, may not be deemed a set-off against his claim, nor a legacy made to a servant a set-off
 against his wages.
 Art. 1024
       A specific legatee is not liable for the debts of the succession, subject to the abatement of the legacy, as above
 stated, and subject to a foreclosure action by creditors.

                        SECTION VIII
                        Of the Revocation of Wills and of their Lapse
 Art. 1035
 Articles 1035 to 1047
       Wills may only be revoked, in whole or in part, by a subsequent will, or by an instrument before notaires, containing
 the declaration of a change of intention.
 Art. 1036
       Subsequent wills which do not revoke previous ones in an express manner annul only those of the dispositions
 therein contained which are inconsistent with the new ones, or which are contrary to them.
 Art. 1037
       A revocation made in a subsequent will produces its full effect, even though the new will is not carried out through a
 disability of the heir appointed or the legatee, or their refusal to take it.
 Art. 1038
       Any transfer made by the testator of all or part of the thing bequeathed, even by a sale with option of redemption or
 by exchange, involves revocation of the legacy as to everything that was transferred, even though the subsequent
 transfer is void and the thing has returned to the hands of the testator.
 Art. 1039
       Any testamentary disposition lapses where the one in whose favour it was made does not survive the testator.
 Art. 1040
       Any testamentary disposition made under a condition depending upon an uncertain event, and such that, in the
 intention of the testator, that disposition is to be carried out only where the event happens or does not happen, lapses if
 the appointed heir or the legatee dies before the condition is fulfilled.
 Art. 1041
       A condition which, in the intention of the testator, only suspends the carrying out of the disposition, does not prevent
 the appointed heir or the legatee from having a vested right transmissible to his heirs.
 Art. 1042
       A legacy lapses, where the thing bequeathed totally perishes in the lifetime of the testator.
       It shall be likewise where it perishes after his death, without the act or fault of the heir, although the latter may have
 been on notice to deliver it, if it would likewise have perished in the hands of the legatee.
 Art. 1043
       A testamentary disposition lapses where the appointed heir or the legatee repudiates it or is incompetent to take it.
 Art. 1044
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 139/268
CIVIL CODE
       There shall be occasion for accruer to the benefit of the legatees, in the case where a legacy is made jointly to
 several of them.
       A legacy shall be deemed jointly made where it is made by one and the same disposition and where the testator did
 not assign the share of each of the co-legatees in the thing bequeathed.
 Art. 1045
       It shall likewise be deemed jointly made when a thing which is not susceptible of being divided without deterioration
 is donated by the same will to several persons, even separately.
 Art. 1046
       The same causes which, according Article 954 and the first two provisions of Article 955, allow a claim for
 revocation of an inter vivos gift, shall justify a claim for revocation of testamentary dispositions.
 Art. 1047
       Where that claim is based upon a grievous insult against the memory of the testator, it must be brought within one
 year after the day of the offence.
                CHAPTER VI
                Of Dispositions Allowed in Favour of Grandchildren of a Donor or Testator or of
 Childrenof his Brothers and Sisters
 Art. 1048
 Articles 1048 to 1074
       Property of which the father and mother may dispose, may be donated by them, in whole or in part, to one or
 several of their children by inter vivos or testamentary act, with the obligation of returning that property to the children
 born and to be born, in the first degree only, of said donees.
 Art. 1049
       Is valid, in case of death without children, a disposition which a deceased made by inter vivos or testamentary act
 for the benefit of one or several of his brothers or sisters, of all or part of the property which is not reserved by law in his
 succession, with the obligation of returning that property to the children born and to be born, in the first degree only, of
 said donee brothers or sisters.
 Art. 1050
       The dispositions allowed by the two preceding Articles are valid only where the obligation to return is for the benefit
 of all the children born and to be born of the institute, without exception or preference by reason of age or sex.
 Art. 1051
       Where, in the above cases, an institute subject to restitution for the benefit of his children dies, leaving children in
 the first degree and descendants of a pre-deceased child, the latter shall take the portion of the pre-deceased child, by
 representation.
 Art. 1052
       Where a child, brother or sister to whom property was donated by an inter vivos act, without obligation of restitution,
 accepts a new gratuitous transfer made by an inter vivos or testamentary act, subject to the condition that the property
 previously donated be burdened with that obligation, they are no longer allowed to divide the two dispositions made for
 their benefit and to renounce the second to be satisfied with the first, even if they offer to return the property included in
 the second gift.
 Art. 1053
       The rights of the substitutes take effect from the time when, for whatever reason, the enjoyment of the child, the
 brother or the sister institutes comes to an end: an anticipated waiver of the enjoyment for the benefit of the institutes
 may not prejudice creditors of the institute antecedent to the waiver.
 Art. 1054
       [repealed by implication]
 Art. 1055
 (Act no 64-1230 of 14 Dec. 1964)
       A person who makes the dispositions allowed by the preceding Articles may, by the same act, or by a subsequent
 act, in authentic form, appoint a guardian in charge of the execution of  those dispositions: that guardian may be
 dispensed only for one of the causes expressed in Articles 428 and following.
 Art. 1056
       Failing such guardian, one shall be named at the suit of the institute or of his guardian where he is a minor, within a
 period of one month after the day of the death of the donor or testator, or after the day when, since that death, the act
 containing the disposition has become known.
 Art. 1057
       An institute who did not comply with the preceding Article loses the benefit of the disposition; and, in that case, the
 right may be declared to be vested in the substitutes, at the suit either of the substitutes where they are of full age, or of
 their guardian or curator, where they are minors or adults in guardianship, or of any relative of the substitutes of full age,
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 140/268

 instance of the place where the succession was opened.
 Art. 1058
       After the death of the person who has disposed with an obligation of restitution, there shall be made, in the ordinary
 forms, an inventory of all the property and effects composing the succession, except, nevertheless, in case of a specific
 legacy. That inventory shall include an appraisal at a fair price of the movables and movable effects.
 Art. 1059
       It shall be done at the request of the institute and within the period fixed in the Title Of Successions, in the presence
 of the guardian appointed for the execution. The expenses shall be taken from the property included in the succession.
 Art. 1060
       Where an inventory was not made on request of the institute within the above period, it shall be done within the
 following month at the suit of the guardian appointed for the execution, in the presence of the institute or of his guardian.
 Art. 1061
       Where the two preceding Articles have not been complied with, the same inventory shall be done, at the suit of the
 persons designated in Article 1057, the institute or his guardian and the guardian appointed for the execution being
 summoned.
 Art. 1062
       The institute shall have a sale passed on to, by bills and auctions, of all the movables and effects included in the
 disposition, with the exception nevertheless of those mentioned in the two following Articles.
 Art. 1063
       The furniture and other movable things which are included in the disposition under the express condition of keeping
 them in kind, shall be returned in the condition in which they are at the time of the restitution.
 Art. 1064
       Cattle and implements used to exploit lands shall be deemed included in the donations inter vivos or testamentary
 of said lands; and the institute is bound only to have them appraised and evaluated, in order to return a like value at the
 time of the restitution.
 Art. 1065
       Within a period of six months after the day of the closing of the inventory, an institute shall invest the ready money,
 the funds coming from the proceeds of the movables and effects which have been sold, and what is received from bills
 receivable.
       That period may be extended if there is occasion.
 Art. 1066
       An institute is likewise bound to invest the funds coming from bills receivable which are recovered and from
 redemptions of annuities; and this, within three months at the latest after he has received them.
 Art. 1067
       That investment shall be made in accordance with the directions of the maker of the disposition, where he
 designated the nature of the property in which the investment must be made; otherwise, it may be made only in
 immovables or with a prior charge on immovables.
 Art. 1068
       The investment prescribed by the preceding Articles shall be made in the presence and at the suit of the guardian
 appointed for the execution.
 Art. 1069
 (Ord. no 59-71 of 7 Jan. 1959)

 institute or of the guardian appointed for the execution, be registered, as to immovables in accordance with the statutes
 and regulations relating to land registration, and as to preferential or mortgaged claims following the prescriptions of
 Articles 2148 and 2149, paragraph 2, of this Code.
 Art. 1070
       Lack of"registration" (Ord. no 59-71 of 7 Jan. 1959) of an instrument containing a disposition may be set up by
 creditors and third parties purchasers, even against minors or adults in guardianship, subject to the remedy against the
 institute and the guardian for the execution, and without the minors or adults in guardianship being reinstated against
 that lack of"registration" (Ord. no 59-71 of 7 Jan. 1959), even where the institute and the guardian are insolvent.
 Art. 1071
       Lack of"registration" (Ord. no 59-71 of 7 Jan. 1959) may not be made good or considered as remedied by
 knowledge which the creditors or third parties purchasers may have had of the disposition in other ways than by
 the"registration" (Ord. no 59-71 of 7 Jan. 1959).
 Art. 1072
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 141/268
CIVIL CODE
       Donees, legatees, and even the [deleted] heirs of the person who made the disposition, and likewise their donees,
 legatees or heirs may not, in any event, set up against the substitutes the lack of"registration" (Ord. no 59-71 of 7 Jan.
 1959) or of recording.
 Art. 1073

 hereabove laid down for establishing the property, for the sale of movables, for the investment of the funds, for the
 registration and recording and, in general, where he has not taken all the necessary steps so that the obligation of
 restitution be well and faithfully fulfilled.
 Art. 1074
       Where the institute is a minor, he may not, even in case of insolvency of his guardian, be reinstated against
 non-compliance with the rules prescribed by the Articles of this Chapter.
                CHAPTER VII
                Of Partitions Made by Ascendants
 Art. 1075
 Articles 1076 to 1075-3
       The father and mother and other ascendants may make a distribution and partition of their property between their
 children and descendants.
       That act may be made under the form of a partition made by gift or of a partition made by will. It shall comply with
 the formalities, requisites and rules prescribed for inter vivos gifts in the first case, and for wills in the second, subject to
 the application of the provisions which follow.
       (Act no 88-15 of 5 Jan. 1988) Where their property includes an individual concern of an industrial, commercial, craft,
 agricultural or professional character, the father and mother and other ascendants may, under the same conditions and
 with the same effects, distribute and partition them between their children and descendants and other persons under the
 form of a partition made by gift, provided the tangible and intangible property allocated for the exploiting of the concern
 is part of that distribution and that partition, and that distribution and that partition have the effect of assigning to those
 other persons only the ownership of all or part of that property or its enjoyment.
 Art. 1075-1
       A partition made by an ascendant may not be attacked for reason of loss.
 Art. 1075-2
       The provisions of Article 833-1, paragraph 1, shall apply to balances which are the responsibility of donees,
 notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary.
 Art. 1075-3
       Where the whole of the property which an ascendant leaves on the day of his or her death has not been included in
 the partition, that item of his or her property which has not been included shall be assigned or partitioned in accordance
 with the law.
                        SECTION I
                        Of Partitions Made by Gifts
 Art. 1076
       A partition made by gift may have as its subject matter only existing property.
 Articles 1076 to 1078-3
       A gift and a partition may be made by separate acts, provided the ascendant is a party to both acts.
 Art. 1077
       Property received by descendants as an anticipated partition constitutes an advancement of their portions of
 reserve, unless it was donated expressly over and above their shares.
 Art. 1077-1
       A descendant who did not participate in a partition made by gift or who received a part below his portion of the
 reserve may bring an action for abatement where there does not exist at the opening of the succession property not
 included in the partition and sufficient to form or make his reserve complete, account being taken of the gratuitous
 transfers by which he may have profited.
 Art. 1077-2
       Partitions made by gifts shall follow the rules of inter vivos gifts for all which regards appropriation, calculation of the
 reserve and abatement.
       An action for abatement may be brought only after the death of the ascendant who made the partition or of the
 survivor of the ascendants in case of joint partition. It is time-barred after five years from the said death.
       A child not yet conceived at the time of a partition made by gift has a similar action to form or make his hereditary
 share complete.
 Art. 1078
       Notwithstanding the rules which apply to inter vivos gifts, the property donated  must, unless otherwise agreed, be
 appraised at the day of the partition made by gift as regards appropriation and calculation of the reserve, provided all the
 children living or represented at the death of the ascendant have received a share in the anticipated partition and have
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 142/268
CIVIL CODE
 expressly accepted it, and no reservation of a usufruct bearing on a sum of money has been provided for.
 Art. 1078-1
       The shares of certain"beneficiaries" (Act no 88-15 of 5 Jan. 1988) may be formed, in whole or in part, from gifts,
 either subject to collation, or over and above their shares, which they already received from the ascendant, with regard
 possibly to the investments and re-investments which they may have made in the interval.
       The date of appraisal applicable to an anticipated partition shall also apply to the previous gifts which are thus
 incorporated into it. Any stipulation to the contrary shall be deemed not written.
 Art. 1078-2
       The parties may also agree that a previous gift over and above a donee's share be incorporated into a partition and
 appropriated to the portion of the reserve of the donee as an advancement.
 Art. 1078-3
       The agreements specified in the two preceding Articles may take place even in the absence of new gifts of the
 ascendant. They shall not be considered as gratuitous transfers between descendants but as a partition made by the
 ascendant.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Partitions Made by Wills
 Art. 1079
 Articles 1079 to 1080
       A partition made by a will produces only the effects of a partition. Its beneficiaries have the capacity of heirs and
 may not forego availing themselves of the will in order to claim a new partition of the succession.
 Art. 1080
       A child or descendant who did not receive a share equal to his portion of the reserve may bring an action for
 abatement in accordance with Article 1077-2.
                CHAPTER VIII
                Of Gifts Made by Ante-nuptial Agreement to Spouses and to Children to be Born of
 the Marriage
 Art. 1081
 Articles 1081 to 1090
       Every inter vivos gift of existing property, although made by an ante-nuptial agreement to the spouses or to one of
 them, is subject to the general rules prescribed for the gifts made as such.
       It may not take place for the benefit of children to be born except in the cases stated in Chapter VI of this Title.
 Art. 1082
       The father and mother, other ascendants, collateral relatives of the spouses and even outsiders may dispose of all
 or part of the property they will leave on the day of their death, by an ante-nuptial agreement, as well for the benefit of
 said spouses, as for the benefit of children to be born of their marriage, in case the donor would survive the donee
 spouse.
       Such gift, although made only for the benefit of the spouses or of one of them, shall always, in the said case of
 survival of the donor, be presumed made for the benefit of the children and descendants to be born of the marriage.
 Art. 1083
       A gift, in the form specified in the preceding Article, is irrevocable, in this sense only that the donor may not dispose
 gratuitously of the property contained in the gift, with the exception of moderate sums, by way of reimbursement or
 otherwise.
 Art. 1084
       A gift by an ante-nuptial agreement may be done cumulatively of existing and future property, in all or in part,
 provided a statement of the debts and charges of the donor existing at the time of the gift is annexed to the instrument;
 in which case, the donee shall be at liberty, at the time of the death of the donor, to retain the existing property, by
 waiving the difference of the donor's property.
 Art. 1085
       Where the statement mentioned in the preceding Article was not annexed to the instrument containing a gift of the
 existing and future property, a donee is obliged to accept or repudiate that gift in whole. In case of acceptance, he may
 claim only the property existing on the day of the death of the donor, and he is liable to pay all the debts and charges of
 the succession.
 Art. 1086
       A gift may also be made by an ante-nuptial agreement in favour of the spouses and of children to be born of their
 marriage, subject to the condition of paying without distinction all the debts and charges of the succession of the donor,
 or subject to other conditions of which the fulfilment depends upon his wish, by whatever person the gift is made: the
 donee is obliged to fulfil the conditions unless he prefers to renounce the gift; and in case a donor by an ante-nuptial
 agreement has reserved to himself the power to dispose of an article included in the gift of his existing property, or of a
 fixed sum to be taken out of that same property, if he dies without having disposed of them, the article or the sum shall
 be deemed included in the gift and shall belong to the donee or his heirs.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 143/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1087
       Gifts made by an ante-nuptial agreement may not be attacked or declared void on the pretext of lack of acceptance.
 Art. 1088
       Any gift made in favour of a marriage lapses where the marriage does not follow.
 Art. 1089
       Gifts made to one of the spouses, under the terms of Articles 1082, 1084 and 1086 above, lapse where the donor
 survives the donee spouse and his or her descendants.
 Art. 1090
       All gifts made to spouses by their ante-nuptial agreement are, when the succession of the donor opens, abatable up
 to the portion which the law allows the donor to dispose of.

                Of Dispositions between Spouses, either by Ante-nuptial Agreement or during
 Marriage
 Art. 1091
 Articles 1091 to 1100
       Spouses may, by an ante-nuptial agreement, make to each other, or one to the other, such gift as they deem
 proper, under the amendments hereafter laid down.
 Art. 1092
       Any inter vivos gift of existing property, made between spouses by an ante-nuptial agreement shall not be deemed
 made under condition of survival of the donee where that condition is not formally expressed; and it shall be subject to
 all the rules and forms above prescribed for these kinds of gifts.
 Art. 1093
       A gift of future property, or of existing and future property, made between spouses by an ante-nuptial agreement,
 either single or reciprocal, shall be subject to the rules laid down by the preceding Chapter, as regards similar gifts made
 by a third person, except that it may not pass to the children born of the marriage, in case of death of the donee spouse
 before the donor spouse.
 Art. 1094
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       A spouse may, either by an antenuptial agreement, or during marriage, in case he or she leaves no [...] children or
 descendants, dispose in favour of the other spouse in ownership, of everything he or she may dispose of in favour of a
 stranger, and, in addition, of the bare ownership of the portion reserved to ascendants by Article 914 of this Code. 
Art. 1094-1
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       Where a spouse leaves children or descendants, [...] born or not of the marriage, [...] he or she may dispose in
 favour of the other spouse, either of ownership of what he or she may dispose of in favour of a stranger, or of one-fourth
 of his property in ownership and of the other three-fourths in usufruct, or else of the totality of property in usufruct only.
 Art. 1094-2
       [repealed]
 Art. 1094-3
 (Act no 72-3 of 3 Jan. 1972)
       Children or descendants may, notwithstanding any stipulation of the disposing party to the contrary, require, as to
 property subject to usufruct, that an inventory of movables as well as a statement of immovables be drawn up, that
 funds be invested and that bearer securities be, at the choice of the usufructuary, converted into registered securities or
 deposited with an accredited depositary.
 Art. 1095
       A minor may, by an ante-nuptial agreement, donate to the other spouse, either by a single gift or by a reciprocal gift,
 only with the consent and assistance of those whose consent is required for the validity of the marriage; and with that
 consent, he may donate everything the law allows a spouse of full age to donate to the other spouse.
 Art. 1096
       (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004).- A gift of future property made between spouses during marriage is always
 revocable.
       A gift of existing property made between spouses may be revocable only subject to the conditions set out in Articles
 953 to 958.
       Gifts of existing or future property made between spouses are not revoked by the unforeseen birth of children.

       Where a remarried spouse made, to his or her second spouse, within the limits of Article 1094-1, a gratuitous
 transfer in ownership, each child of the first bed has, so far as he is concerned, unless otherwise unequivocally directed
 by the disposing party, the power to substitute to the fulfilment of that transfer the waiver of the usufruct of the share of
 succession he would have received failing a surviving spouse.
       Those who have exercised that power may require the application of the provisions of Article 1094-3.
 Art. 1099
       Spouses may not indirectly donate to each other more what they are allowed by the above provisions.
       [repealed]
 Art. 1099-1
 (Act no 67-1179 of 28 Dec. 1967)
       Where a spouse acquires a property with funds which were donated to him or her by the other for that purpose, the
 gift is only of the funds and not of the property in which they were invested.
       In that case, the rights of the donor or of his or her heirs have as their subject matter a sum of money according to
 the present value of the property. Where the property has been transferred, one considers the value it had on the day of
 the transfer, and where a new property has been substituted to the property transferred, the value of that new property.

        TITLE III
        OF CONTRACTS AND OF CONVENTIONAL OBLIGATIONS IN GENERAL
                CHAPTER I
                Preliminary Provisions
 Art. 1101
 Articles 1101 to
 1369-11
 Articles 1101 to 1107
       A contract is an agreement by which one or several persons bind themselves, towards one or several others, to
 transfer, to do or not to do something.
 Art. 1102
       A contract is synallagmatic or bilateral where the contracting parties bind themselves mutually towards each other.
 Art. 1103
       It is unilateral where one or more persons are bound towards one or several others, without there being any
 obligation on the part of the latter.
 Art. 1104
       It is commutative where each party binds himself to transfer or do a thing which is considered as the equivalent of
 what is transferred to him or of what is done for him.
       Where the equivalent consists in a chance of gain or of loss for each party, depending upon an uncertain event, a
 contract is aleatory.
 Art. 1105
       A contract of benevolence is one by which one of the parties procures a purely gratuitous advantage to the other.
 Art. 1106
       A contract for value is one which obliges each party to transfer or do something.
 Art. 1107
       Contracts, whether they have a specific denomination or not, are subject to general rules, which are the subject
 matter of this Title.
       Particular rules for certain contracts are laid down under the Titles relating to each of them; and the particular rules
 for commercial transactions are laid down by the legislation that relates to commerce.
                CHAPTER II
                Of the Essential Requisites for the Validity of Agreements
 Art. 1108
       Four requisites are essential for the validity of an agreement:
       The consent of the party who binds himself;
       His capacity to contract;
       A definite object which forms the subject-matter of the undertaking;
       A lawful cause in the obligation.
 Art. 1108-1
 Articles 1109 to 1108-2
       (Act no 2004-575 of 21 June 2004).- Where a writing is required for the validity of a legal transaction, it may be
 established and stored in electronic form in the way provided for in Articles 1316-1 and 1316-4 and, where an authentic
 instrument is required, in Article 1317, paragraph 2. 
Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 145/268
CIVIL CODE
       Where a mention written in the own hand of the person who binds himself is required, the latter may appose it in
 electronic form where the conditions in which it is apposed are likely to vouch that it can only be apposed by the person
 himself.
 Art. 1108-2
       (Act no 2004-575 of 21 June 2004).- Exception is made to the provisions of Article 1108-1 in regard to:
       1° Instruments under private signature relating to family law and the law of succession; 
       2° Instruments under private signature relating to suretyship or property charge, of commercial or non-commercial
 character, except where they are drawn up by a person for the needs of his occupation. 
                        SECTION I
                        Of Consent
 Art. 1109
 Articles 1109 to 1122
       There is no valid consent, where the consent was given only by error, or where it was extorted by duress or abused
 by deception.
 Art. 1110
       Error is a ground for annulment of an agreement only where it rests on the very substance of the thing which is the
 object thereof.
       It is not a ground for annulment where it only rests on the person with whom one has the intention of contracting,
 unless regard to/for that person was the main cause of the agreement.
 Art. 1111
       Duress exerted against the person who has contracted the obligation is a ground for annulment even though it was
 exerted by a third party different from the one for whose benefit the agreement was made.
 Art. 1112
       There is duress where it is of a nature to make an impression upon a reasonable person and where it can inspire
 him with a fear of exposing his person or his wealth to considerable and present harm.
       Regard shall be paid, on this question, to the age, the sex and the condition of the persons.
 Art. 1113
       Duress is a ground for annulment of a contract, where it is exerted not only against a contracting party, but also
 against the party's spouse, against his or her descendants or ascendants.
 Art. 1114
       Reverential fear alone towards a father, mother or other ascendant, without any duress being exerted , may not
 suffice to annul a contract.
 Art. 1115
       A contract may no longer be attacked on the ground of duress where, since duress has ceased, that contract has
 been approved, either expressly, or by conduct, or in letting the time fixed by law for restitution elapse.
 Art. 1116
       Deception is a ground for annulment of a contract where the schemes used by one of the parties are such that it is
 obvious that, without them, the other party would not have entered into the contract.
       It may not be presumed, and must be proved.
 Art. 1117
       An agreement entered into by error, duress or deception is not void by operation of law; it only gives rise to an
 action for annulment or rescission, in the cases and in the manner explained in Section VII of Chapter V of this Title.
 Art. 1118
       Loss vitiates agreements only in certain contracts and with regard to certain persons, as will be explained in the
 same Section.
 Art. 1119
       As a rule, one may, bind oneself and stipulate in his own name, only for oneself.
 Art. 1120
       One may, nevertheless stand guarantee for a third party, by promising his acting; subject to a compensation against
 him who stood guarantee or promised to obtain ratification, where the third party refuses to keep the undertaking.
 Art. 1121
       One may likewise stipulate for the benefit of a third party, where it is the condition of a stipulation which one makes
 for oneself or of a gift which one makes to another. He who made that stipulation may no longer revoke it, where the
 third party declares that he wishes to take advantage of it.
 Art. 1122
       One is deemed to have stipulated for himself and for his heirs and assigns, unless the contrary is expressed or
 results from the nature of the agreement.

CIVIL CODE
                        SECTION II
 Articles 1123 to 1125-1
                        Of the Capacity of Contracting Parties
 Art. 1123
       Any person may enter into a contract, unless he has been declared incapable of it by law.
 Art. 1124
 (Act no 68-5 of 3 Jan. 1968)
       Are incapable of entering into a contract, to the extent defined by law:
       Non-emancipated minors;
       Adults protected within the meaning of Article 488 of this Code.
 Art. 1125
 (Act no 68-5 of 3 Jan. 1968)
       Persons capable of binding themselves may not set up the incapacity of those with whom they have made a
 contract.
 Art. 1125-1
 (Act no 68-5 of 3 Jan. 1968)
       Except for authorization by court, it is forbidden, on pain of annulment, for whomever exercises a function or fills an
 employment in an institution sheltering elderly persons or dispensing psychiatric care, to stand as purchaser of a
 property or assignee of a right belonging to a person admitted to the institution, or to take on lease lodgings occupied by
 that person before his admission to the institution.
       For the implementation of this Article, shall be deemed intermediaries, the spouse, ascendants and descendants of
 the persons to whom the above-enacted prohibitions apply.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Object and Subject Matter Of Contracts
 Art. 1126
 Articles 1126 to 1130
       Any contract has for its object a thing which one party binds himself to transfer, or which one party binds himself to
 do or not to do.
 Art. 1127
       The mere use or the mere possession of a thing may be the object of a contract, like the thing itself.
 Art. 1128
       Only things which may be the subject matter of legal transactions between private individuals may be the object of
 agreements.
 Art. 1129
       An obligation must have for its object a thing determined at least as to its kind.
       The quantity of the thing may be uncertain, provided it can be determined.
 Art. 1130
       Future things may be the object of an obligation.
       One may not however renounce a succession which is not open, or make any stipulation with respect to such
 succession, even with the consent of him whose succession is concerned.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Cause
 Art. 1131
 Articles 1131 to 1133
       An obligation without cause or with a false cause, or with an unlawful cause, may not have any effect.
 Art. 1132
       An agreement is nevertheless valid, although its cause is not expressed.
 Art. 1133
       A cause is unlawful where it is prohibited by legislation, where it is contrary to public morals or to public policy.
                CHAPTER III
                Of the Effect of Obligations
                        SECTION I
                        General Provisions
 Art. 1134
       Agreements lawfully entered into take the place of the law for those who have made them.
       They may be revoked only by mutual consent, or for causes authorized by law.
       They must be performed in good faith.
 Art. 1135
 Articles 1134 to 1167
 Articles 1134 to 1135
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 147/268
CIVIL CODE
       Agreements are binding not only as to what is therein expressed, but also as to all the consequences which equity,
 usage or statute give to the obligation according to its nature.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Obligation to Transfer
 Art. 1136
 Articles 1136 to 1141
       An obligation to transfer carries that of delivering the thing and of keeping it until delivery, on pain of damages to the
 creditor.
 Art. 1137
       An obligation to watch over the preservation of a thing, whether the agreement has as its object the profit of one
 party, or it has as its object their common profit, compels the one who is responsible to give it all the care of a prudent
 administrator.
       That obligation is more or less extensive as regards certain contracts, whose effects, in this respect, are explained
 under the Titles which relate to them.
 Art. 1138
       An obligation of delivering a thing is complete by the sole consent of the contracting parties.
       It makes the creditor the owner and places the thing at his risks from the time when it should have been delivered,
 although the handing over has not been made, unless the debtor has been given notice to deliver; in which case, the
 thing remains at the risk of the latter.
 Art. 1139
       A debtor is given notice of default either through a demand or other equivalent act"such as a letter missive, where a
 sufficient requisition results from its terms" (Act no 91-650 of 9 July 1991), or by the effect of the agreement where it
 provides that the debtor will be put in default without any notice and through the mere expiry of time.
 Art. 1140
       The effects of an obligation to convey or deliver an immovable are regulated in the Title Of Sales and in the Title Of
 Prior Charges and Mortgages.
 Art. 1141
       Where a thing which one is bound to transfer or deliver to two persons successively is purely movable, the one of
 the two who has been put in actual possession is preferred and remains owner of it, although his title is subsequent as
 to date, provided however that the possession is in good faith.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Obligation to Do or not to Do
 Art. 1142
 Articles 1142 to 1145
       Any obligation to do or not to do resolves itself into damages, in case of non-performance on the part of the debtor.
 Art. 1143
       Nevertheless, a creditor is entitled to request that what has been done through breach of the undertaking be
 destroyed; and he may have himself authorized to destroy it at the expense of the debtor, without prejudice to damages,
 if there is occasion.
 Art. 1144
       A creditor may also, in case of non-performance, be authorized to have the obligation performed himself, at the
 debtor's expense ."The latter may be ordered to advance the sums necessary for that performance" (Act no 91-650 of 9
 July 1991).
 Art. 1145
       Where there is an obligation not to do, he who violates it owes damages by the mere fact of the violation.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Damages Resulting from the Non-Performance of an Obligation
 Art. 1146
 Articles 1146 to 1155
       Damages are due only where a debtor is given notice to fulfil his obligation, except nevertheless where the thing
 which the debtor has bound himself to transfer or to do could be
       transferred or done only within a certain time which he has allowed to elapse."Notice of default may follow from a
 letter missive where a sufficient requisition results from it" (Act no 91-650 of 9 July 1991).
 Art. 1147
       A debtor shall be ordered to pay damages, if there is occasion, either by reason of the non-performance of the
 obligation, or by reason of delay in performing, whenever he does not prove that the non-performance comes from an
 external cause which may not be ascribed to him, although there is no bad faith on his part.
 Art. 1148
       There is no occasion for any damages where a debtor was prevented from transferring or from doing that to which
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 148/268
CIVIL CODE
 he was bound, or did what was forbidden to him, by reason of force majeure or of a fortuitous event.
 Art. 1149
       Damages due to a creditor are, as a rule, for the loss which he has suffered and the profit which he has been
 deprived of, subject to the exceptions and modifications below.
 Art. 1150
       A debtor is liable only for damages which were foreseen or which could have been foreseen at the time of the
 contract, where it is not through his own intentional breach that the obligation is not fulfilled.
 Art. 1151
       Even in the case where the non-performance of the agreement is due to the debtor's intentional breach, damages
 may include, with respect to the loss suffered by the creditor and the profit which he has been deprived of, only what is
 an immediate and direct consequence of the non-performance of the agreement.
 Art. 1152
       Where an agreement provides that he who fails to perform it will pay a certain sum as damages, the other party may
 not be awarded a greater or lesser sum.
       (Act no 75-597 of 9 July 1975) Nevertheless, the judge may"even of his own motion" (Act no 85-1097 of 11 Oct.
 1985) moderate or increase the agreed penalty, where it is obviously excessive or ridiculously low. Any stipulation to the
 contrary shall be deemed unwritten.
 Art. 1153
       (Act no 75-619 of 11 July 1975) In obligations which are restricted to the payment of a certain sum, the damages
 resulting from delay in performance shall consist only in awarding interests at the statutory rate, except for special rules
 for commerce and suretyship.
       (Ord. no 59-148 of 7 Jan. 1959) Those damages are due without the creditor having to prove any loss.
       (Act no 75-619 of 11 July 1975) They are due only from the day of a demand for payment"or of another equivalent
 act such as a letter missive where a sufficient requisition results from it" (Act no 92-644 of 13 July 1992), except in the
 case where the law makes them run as a matter of right.
       (Act of 7 April 1900) A creditor to whom his debtor in delay has caused, by his bad faith, a loss independent of that
 delay may obtain damages distinct from the interest on arrears of the debt.
 Art. 1153-1
 (Act no 85-677 of 5 July 1985)
       In all matters, the award of a compensation involves interest at the statutory rate even failing a claim or a specific
 provision in the judgment. Save as otherwise provided by legislation, that interest runs from the handing down of the
 judgment unless the judge otherwise rules .  In case a udgment  allowing an indemnity for compensation of a loss is
 unreservedly affirmed by an appellate judge,  the determination as a matter of law produces interest as from the
 judgment of first instance. In the other cases, an indemnity allowed on appeal produces interest from the judgment given
 in appeal. The appellate judge may always derogate from the provisions of this paragraph.
 Art. 1154
       Interests due on capital may produce interest, either by a judicial claim, or by a special agreement, provided that,
 either in the claim, or in the agreement, the interest concerned be owed at least for one whole year.
 Art. 1155
       Nevertheless, the revenue owed, such as farm rents, rents, arrearages of perpetual or life annuities, produce
 interest from the day of the claim or of the agreement.
       The same rule shall apply to the restitution of fruits and to interest paid by a third party to a creditor on behalf of the
 debtor.
                        SECTION V
                        Of the Interpretation of Agreements
 Art. 1156
 Articles 1156 to 1164
       One must in agreements seek what the common intention of the contracting parties was, rather than pay attention
 to the literal meaning of the terms.
 Art. 1157
       Where a clause admits of two meanings, one shall rather understand it in the one with which it may have some
 effect, than in the meaning with which it could not produce any.
 Art. 1158
       Terms which admit of two meanings shall be taken in the meaning which best suits the subject matter of the
 contract.
 Art. 1159
       What is ambiguous shall be interpreted by what is in use in the region where the contract was made.
 Art. 1160
       Terms which are customary shall be supplemented in the contract, even though they are not expressed there.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 149/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1161
       All the clauses of an agreement are to be interpreted with reference to one another by giving to each one the
 meaning which results from the whole instrument.
 Art. 1162
       In case of doubt, an agreement shall be interpreted against the one who has stipulated, and in favour of the one
 who has contracted the obligation.
 Art. 1163
       However general the terms in which an agreement is phrased may be, it shall include only the things upon which
 the parties appear to have intended to contract.
 Art. 1164
       Where in a contract one case was expressed for explaining the obligation, it shall not be deemed that it was thereby
 intended to reduce the scope of the agreement which extends as of right to cases not expressed.
                        SECTION VI
                        Of the Effect of Agreements with Respect to Third Parties
 Art. 1165
 Articles 1165 to 1167
       Agreements produce effect only between the contracting parties; they do not harm a third party, and they benefit
 him only in the case provided for in Article 1121.
 Art. 1166
       Nevertheless, creditors may exercise their debtor's rights and actions, except those which are exclusively
 dependent on the person.
 Art. 1167
       They may also, on their own behalf, attack transactions made by their debtor in fraud of their rights.
       (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965) They shall nevertheless, as to those of their rights which are laid down in the Title
 Of Ante-nuptial Agreement and of Matrimonial Regimes, comply with the rules therein prescribed.
                CHAPTER IV
                Of the Various Kinds of Obligations
                        SECTION I
                        Of Conditional Obligations
                                Paragraph 1
                                Of Condition in General and of its Various Kinds
 Art. 1168
 Articles 1168 to 1233
 Articles 1168 to 1184
 Articles 1168 to 1180
       An obligation is conditional where it is made to depend upon a future and uncertain event, either by suspending it
 until the event happens, or by cancelling it, according to whether the event happens or not.
 Art. 1169
       A casual condition is one which depends upon chance and which is in no way in the power of the creditor or of the
 debtor.
 Art. 1170
       A potestative condition is one which makes the fulfilment of the agreement depend upon an event which one or the
 other of the contracting parties has the power to make happen or to prevent.
 Art. 1171
       A mixed condition is one which depends at the same time upon the wish of one of the contracting parties, and upon
 the wish of a third party.
 Art. 1172
       Any condition relating to an impossible thing, or contrary to public morals, or prohibited by law, is void, and renders
 void the agreement which depends upon it.
 Art. 1173
       A condition not to do an impossible thing does not render void the obligation contracted upon that condition.
 Art. 1174
       An obligation is void where it was contracted subject to a potestative condition on the part of the one who binds
 himself.
 Art. 1175
       Every condition must be fulfilled in the manner in which the parties have in all likelihood wished and intended that it
 should be.
 Art. 1176
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 150/268
CIVIL CODE
       Where an obligation is contracted subject to the condition that an event will happen within a fixed time, that
 condition is deemed failed where the time has elapsed without the event having happened . Where there is no time
 fixed, the condition may always be fulfilled; and it is deemed failed only when it has become certain that the event will
 not happen.
 Art. 1177
       Where an obligation is contracted subject to the condition that an event will not happen in a fixed time, that condition
 is fulfilled when that time has expired without the event having happened: it is so too when, before the term, it is certain
 that the event will not happen; and where there is no determined time, it is fulfilled only when it is certain that the event
 will not happen.
 Art. 1178
       A condition is deemed fulfilled where it is the debtor, bound under that condition, who has prevented it from being
 fulfilled.
 Art. 1179
       A condition which is fulfilled has a retroactive effect to the day when the undertaking was contracted. Where  the
 creditor dies before the condition is fulfilled, his rights pass to his heir.
 Art. 1180
       A creditor may, before the condition is fulfilled, take all steps to preserve his right.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of Condition Precedent
 Art. 1181
 Articles 1181 to 1182
       An obligation contracted under a condition precedent is one which depends either on a future and uncertain event,
 or on an event having presently happened, but still unknown to the parties.
       In the first case, the obligation may be performed only after the event.
       In the second case, the obligation takes effect as from the day when it was contracted.
 Art. 1182
       Where an obligation was contracted under a condition precedent, the thing which is the subject matter of the
 agreement remains at the risk of the debtor who has bound himself to deliver it only in the case of the occurrence of the
 condition.
       Where the thing perishes entirely, without the fault of the debtor, the obligation is extinguished.
       Where the thing has been deteriorated without the fault of the debtor, the creditor has the choice either to avoid the
 obligation, or to demand the thing in the condition in which it is, without any price reduction.
       Where the thing has been deteriorated through fault of the debtor, the creditor has the right either to avoid the
 obligation, or to demand the thing in the condition in which it is, with damages.
                                Paragraph 3
                                Of Condition Subsequent
 Art. 1183
 Articles 1183 to 1184
       A condition subsequent is one which, when it is fulfilled, brings about the revocation of the obligation, and which
 puts things back in the same condition as if the obligation had not existed.
       It does not suspend the fulfilment of the obligation; it only compels the creditor to return what he has received, in the
 case where the event contemplated by the condition happens.
 Art. 1184
       A condition subsequent is always implied in synallagmatic contracts, for the case where one of the two parties does
 not carry out his undertaking.
       In that case, the contract is not avoided as of right. The party towards whom the undertaking has not been fulfilled
 has the choice either to compel the other to fulfil the agreement when it is possible, or to request its avoidance with
 damages.
       Avoidance must be applied for in court, and the defendant may be granted time according to circumstances.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Obligations with a Term
 Art. 1185
 Articles 1185 to 1188
       A term differs from a condition, in that it does not suspend the undertaking, of which it only delays the fulfilment.
 Art. 1186
       What is due only with a term may not be claimed before the expiry of the term; but what was paid in advance may
 not be recovered.
 Art. 1187
       A term is always presumed stipulated in favour of the debtor, unless it follows from the stipulation, or from the
 circumstances, that it was also agreed in favour of the creditor.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1188
 (Act no 85-98 of 25 Jan. 1985)
       A debtor may no longer claim the benefit of a term where by his own act he has lessened the guarantees which he
 had given his creditor by the contract.
                        SECTION III
                        Of Alternative Obligations
 Art. 1189
 Articles 1189 to 1196
       The debtor of an alternative obligation is discharged by the delivery of one of the two things which were included in
 the obligation.
 Art. 1190
       The choice belongs to the debtor, where it was not expressly granted to the creditor.
 Art. 1191
       A debtor may discharge himself by delivering one of the things promised; but he may not compel the creditor to
 receive a part of one and a part of the other.
 Art. 1192
       An obligation is outright, although contracted in an alternative manner, where one of the two things promised could
 not be the subject matter of the obligation.
 Art. 1193
       An alternative obligation becomes outright, where one of the things promised perishes and may no longer be
 delivered, even through the fault of the debtor. The price of that thing may not be offered in its place.
       Where both have perished, and the debtor is at fault as to one of them, he shall pay the price of the one which has
 perished last.
 Art. 1194
       Where, in the cases provided for in the preceding Article, the choice was conferred to the creditor under the
 agreement,
       Either one of the things only has perished; and then, if it is without fault of the debtor, the creditor shall have the one
 which remains; if the debtor is at fault, the creditor may demand the thing which remains, or the price of the one which
 has perished;
       Or both things have perished; and then, if the debtor is at fault as to both, or even only as to one of them, the
 creditor may demand the price of one or the other, at his choice.
 Art. 1195
       Where both things have perished without the fault of the debtor, and before he was put in default, the obligation is
 extinguished, in accordance with Article 1302.
 Art. 1196
       The same principles shall apply in case there are more than two things included in the alternative obligation.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Joint and Several Obligations
                                Paragraph 1
                                Of Joint and Several Creditors
 Art. 1197
 Articles 1197 to 1216
 Articles 1197 to 1199
       An obligation is joint and several between several creditors, where the instrument of title expressly gives to each of
 them the right to demand payment of the whole claim, and payment made to one of them discharges the debtor,
 although the benefit of the obligation is to be partitioned and divided between the various creditors.
 Art. 1198
       It is at the choice of the debtor to pay one or another of joint and several creditors , so long as he is not prevented
 by legal proceedings instituted by one of them.
       Nevertheless, a release given by only one of the joint and several creditors discharges the debtor only for the share
 of that creditor.
 Art. 1199
       An act which interrupts the running of the statute of limitation with respect to one of the joint and several creditors
 benefits the other creditors.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of Joint and Several Debtors
 Art. 1200
 Articles 1200 to 1216
       There is joint and several liability on the part of debtors where they are bound for a same thing, so that each one
 may be compelled for the whole, and payment made by one alone discharges the others towards the creditor.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 152/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1201
       An obligation may be joint and several although one of the debtors is bound differently from another for payment of
 the same thing; for instance, where one is bound only conditionally, whereas the other's undertaking  is outright, or
 where one has been given time which has not been granted to the other.
 Art. 1202
       Joint and several liability may not be presumed: it must be expressly stipulated.
       This rule only ceases in the cases where joint and several liability exists as a matter of right, under a statutory
 provision.
 Art. 1203
       A creditor of an obligation contracted jointly and severally may apply to the one of the debtors he wishes to choose,
 without the latter being allowed to set up the benefit of division.
 Art. 1204
       Proceedings brought against one of the debtors do not prevent the creditor from instituting similar ones against the
 others.
 Art. 1205
       Where a thing due has perished through the fault of one or several of the joint and several debtors or after they
 were given notice of default, the other debtors are not discharged from the obligation to pay the price of the thing; but
 they are not liable for damages.
       The creditor may only recover damages from the debtors through whose fault the thing has perished or from those
 who were under notice of default.
 Art. 1206
       Proceedings instituted against one of the joint and several debtors interrupts the running of the statute of limitation
 with respect to all.
 Art. 1207
       A demand for interest brought against one of the joint and several debtors causes interest to run with respect to all.
 Art. 1208
       A joint and several co-debtor sued by the creditor may set up all the defences which result from the nature of the
 obligation, and all those which are personal to him, as well as those which are common to all the co-debtors.
       He may not set up defences which are purely personal to some of the other co-debtors.
 Art. 1209
       Where one of the debtors becomes the sole heir of the creditor, or where the creditor becomes the sole heir of one
 of the debtors, the merger extinguishes the joint and several claim only for the share and portion of the debtor or of the
 creditor.
 Art. 1210
       A creditor who consents to a division of the debt with respect to one of the co-debtors retains his joint and several
 action against the others, but only under deduction of the share of the debtor whom he has discharged from the joint and
 several liability.
 Art. 1211
       A creditor who receives severally the share of one of his debtors, without reserving in the receipt the joint and
 several liability or his rights in general, renounces joint and several liability only with respect to this debtor.
       A creditor is not deemed to release the debtor from the joint and several liability where he receives from him a sum
 equal to the portion for which he is bound, where the receipt does not mention that it is for his share.
       It shall be likewise as to a mere claim brought against one of the debtors for his share, where the latter has not
 admitted the claim, or where  no compensatory judgment has been handed down.
 Art. 1212
       A creditor who receives severally and without reservation from one the co-debtors his portion in the arrears or
 interest on the debt, loses the joint and several liability only for the arrears or interest due, not for those to become due
 or for the capital, unless the several payment has been continuing for ten consecutive years.
 Art. 1213
       An obligation contracted jointly and severally towards a creditor is divided by operation of law between the debtors,
 who are  liable between themselves only each one for his share and portion.
 Art. 1214
       The co-debtor of a joint and several obligation, who paid it in full, may recover from the others only the share and
 portion of each one of them.
       Where one of them is insolvent, the loss occasioned by his insolvency shall be apportioned pro rata between all the
 other solvent co-debtors and the one who made the payment.
 Art. 1215
       In case the creditor waives the joint and several action with respect to one of the debtors, if one or several of the
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 153/268
CIVIL CODE
 other co-debtors become insolvent, the portion of those insolvent shall be apportioned pro rata between all the debtors,
 even between those previously discharged from the joint and several liability by the creditor.
 Art. 1216
       Where the affair for which the debt was contracted jointly and severally concerns only one of the joint and several
 co-obligors, the latter are liable for the whole debt towards the other co-debtors, who must be considered with regard to
 him only as his sureties.
                        SECTION V
                        Of Divisible and Indivisible Obligations
 Art. 1217
 Articles 1220 to 1219
       An obligation is divisible or indivisible according to whether its object is a thing which in its delivery, or an act which
 in its performance, is or not susceptible of a division either physical or intellectual.
 Art. 1218
       An obligation is indivisible, although the thing or act which is its object is divisible by its nature, where the way in
 which it is considered in the obligation does not render it susceptible to part performance.
 Art. 1219
       A stipulated joint and several liability does not give the character of indivisibility to an obligation.
                                Paragraph 1
                                Of the Effects of Divisible Obligations
 Art. 1220
 Articles 1220 to 1221
       An obligation which is susceptible of being divided must be performed between the creditor and the debtor as
 though it were indivisible. Divisibility operates only as to their heirs, who may claim the debt or are bound to pay it only
 for the shares which they receive or for which they are liable as representing the creditor or the debtor.
 Art. 1221
       The principle established in the preceding Article is subject to exceptions, with regard to the heirs of a debtor:
       1° Where the debt is secured by a mortgage;
       2° Where it is of a thing certain;
       3° Where it is a question of an alternative debt of things at the choice of the creditor, of which one is indivisible;
       4° Where one of the heirs is made alone responsible, by the instrument of title, of the performance of the obligation;
       5° Where it results, either from the nature of the undertaking, or from the thing which is the object of it, or from the
 purpose intended in the contract, that the intention of the contracting parties was that the debt should not be partially
 discharged.
       In the first three cases, the heir who possesses the thing due or the tenement mortgaged for the debt may be sued
 for the whole on the thing due or on the tenement mortgaged, subject to his remedy against his co-heirs. In the fourth
 case, the heir who is alone responsible for the debt, and in the fifth case, each heir, may also be sued for the whole,
 subject to his remedy against his co-heirs.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of the Effects of Indivisible Obligations
 Art. 1222
 Articles 1222 to 1225
       Each one of those who have jointly contracted an indivisible debt is liable for the whole, although the obligation was
 not contracted jointly and severally.
 Art. 1223
       It shall be likewise with regard to the heirs of a person who has contracted such an obligation.
 Art. 1224
       Each heir of the creditor may demand performance of an indivisible obligation in whole.
       He may not release alone the whole debt; he may not receive alone the price instead of the thing. Where one of the
 heirs has alone released the debt or received the price of the thing, his co-heir may claim the indivisible thing only by
 taking into account the portion of the co-heir who has given the release or received the price.
 Art. 1225
       An heir of the debtor, who is sued for the whole obligation, may request time for joining his co-heirs in the action,
 unless the debt is of such a nature that it can be discharged only by the sued heir, against whom judgment may then be
 given, subject to his remedy for compensation against his co-heirs.
                        SECTION VI
                        Of Obligations with Penalty Clauses
 Art. 1226
 Articles 1226 to 1233
       A penalty is a clause by which a person, in order to ensure performance of an agreement, binds himself to
 something in case of non-performance.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 154/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1227
       Nullity of the principal obligation involves that of the penalty clause.
       Nullity of the latter does no involve that of the principal obligation.
 Art. 1228
       A creditor, instead of claiming the penalty stipulated against the debtor who is under notice of default, may proceed
 with the performance of the principal obligation.
 Art. 1229
       A penalty clause is a compensation for the damages which the creditor suffers from the non-performance of the
 principal obligation.
       He may not claim at the same time the principal and the penalty, unless it was stipulated for a mere delay.
 Art. 1230
       Whether the original obligation contains, or not a term within which it must be performed, the penalty is incurred only
 where the one who is bound either to deliver, or to take, or to do, is under notice of default.
 Art. 1231
 (Act no 75-597 of 9 July 1975)
       Where an undertaking has been performed in part, the agreed penalty may", even of his own motion," (Act no
 85-1097 of 11 Oct. 1985) be lessened by the judge in proportion to the interest which the part performance has procured
 for the creditor, without prejudice to the application of Article 1152. Any stipulation to the contrary shall be deemed  not
 written.
 Art. 1232
       Where an original obligation contracted with a penalty clause relates to an indivisible thing, the penalty is incurred
 by the breach of only one of the heirs of the debtor, and it may be claimed, either for the whole against the person in
 breach, or against each of the co-heirs for their share and portion, and by mortgage for the whole, subject to their
 remedy against the one who caused the penalty to be incurred.
 Art. 1233
       Where an original obligation contracted under a penalty is divisible, the penalty is incurred by the one of the debtor's
 heirs who contravenes that obligation, and for the share only for which he was bound in the principal obligation, without
 there being any action against those who have performed it.
       An exception is made to this rule where the penalty clause having been added for the purpose that payment may
 not be made partially, a co-heir has prevented the performance of the obligation in whole. In that case, the entire penalty
 may be claimed against him, and against the other co-heirs for their portion only, and subject to their remedy.
                CHAPTER V
                Of the Extinguishment of Obligations
 Art. 1234
       Obligations are extinguished:
       By payment;
       By novation;
       By voluntary release;
       By set-off;
       By merger;
       By the loss of the thing;
       By nullity or rescission;
       By the effect of a condition subsequent, as was explained in the preceding Chapter; and
       By the running of the statute of limitation, which will be the subject matter of a special Title.
                        SECTION I
                        Of Payment
                                Paragraph 1
                                Of Payment in General
 Art. 1235
 Articles 1235 to 1234
 Articles 1235 to 1265 to
 1270
 Articles 1235 to 1248
       Any payment supposes a debt: what has been paid without being owed is subject to restitution.
       Restitution is not allowed with respect to natural obligations which were voluntarily discharged.
 Art. 1236
       An obligation may be discharged by any person having an interest therein, such as a co-obligee or a surety.
       An obligation may even be discharged by a third party who has no interest therein, provided that party acts in the
 name and on behalf of the debtor, or, where he acts in his own name, he is not subrogated to the rights of the creditor.
 Art. 1237
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 155/268
CIVIL CODE
       An obligation to do may not be discharged by a third party against the wish of the creditor, where the latter has an
 interest in having it performed by the debtor himself.
 Art. 1238
       In order to pay validly, one must be the owner of the thing given in payment, and be capable of transferring it.
       Nevertheless, the  payment of a sum of money or of some other thing which is consumed by use, may not be
 recovered from a creditor who has consumed it in good faith, although the payment of it was made by a person who was
 not the owner or who was not capable of transferring it.
 Art. 1239
       Payment must be made to the creditor, or somebody having authority from him, or authorized by the court or by
 statute to receive for him.
       Payment made to a person who has no authority to receive for the creditor, is valid, where the latter ratifies it or has
 profited by it.
 Art. 1240
       Payment made in good faith to one who was in possession of the claim is valid, even if the possessor is afterwards
 dispossessed.
 Art. 1241
       Payment made to a creditor is not valid, where he was incapable of receiving it, unless the debtor proves that the
 thing paid has turned to the advantage of the creditor.
 Art. 1242
       Payment made by a debtor to his creditor, notwithstanding an attachment or a garnishment is not valid, with respect
 to the attaching or garnishing creditors: the latter may, according to their rights, compel him to pay again, subject, in that
 case only, to his remedy against the creditor.
 Art. 1243
       A creditor may not be compelled to receive a thing different from the one which is owed to him, although the value
 of the thing offered is equal or even greater.
 Art. 1244
 (Act no 91-650 of 9 July 1991)
       A debtor may not compel a creditor to receive  payment in part of a debt, even divisible.
 Art. 1244-1
 (Act no 91-650 of 9 July 1991)
       However, taking into account the debtor's position and in consideration of the creditor's needs, a judge may, within a
 two-year limit, defer or spread out the payment of sums due.
       By a special judgement, setting out the grounds on which it is based,
       , the judge may order that the sums corresponding to the deferred due dates carry interest at a reduced rate which
 may not be lower than the statutory rate or that the payments be appropriated first to the capital.
       Furthermore, he may subordinate those measures to the performance, by the debtor, of acts appropriate for
 facilitating or guaranteeing the payment of the debt.
       The provisions of this Article shall not apply to debts for maintenance.
 Art. 1244-2
 (Act no 91-650 of 9 July 1991)
       The     judgment handed down under Article 1244-1 stays,  the enforcement proceedings which may have been
 instituted by the creditor. Increases of interest or penalties incurred because of delay cease to be due during the period
 fixed by the judge.
 Art. 1244-3
 (Act no 91-650 of 9 July 1991)
       Any stipulation contrary to the provisions of Articles 1244-1 and 1244-2 shall be deemed not written.
 Art. 1245
       The debtor of a thing certain and determined is discharged by the delivery of the thing in the condition in which it is
 at the time of delivery, provided that deteriorations which happened to it did not come from his act or his fault, or from
 that of persons for whom he is responsible, or that before those deteriorations he was not under notice of default.
 Art. 1246
       Where a debt is of a thing determined only as to its kind, a debtor is not obliged to give it in the best of its kind; but
 he may not offer it in its worst.
 Art. 1247
 (Ord. no 58-1298 of 23 Dec. 1958)
       Payment must be made in the place designated by the agreement . Where a place is not designated, payment, if it
 is for a thing certain and determined, must be made at the place where the thing forming the object of the obligation was
 at the time of that obligation.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 156/268
CIVIL CODE
       Periodical payments ordered for maintenance must be made, subject to a contrary order of the judge, at the
 domicile or at the residence of the person who is to receive them.
       Apart from those cases, payment must be made at the domicile of the debtor.
 Art. 1248
       The costs of payment are borne by the debtor.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of Payment with Subrogation
 Art. 1249
 Articles 1249 to 1252
       Subrogation to the rights of a creditor for the benefit of a third person who pays him is either conventional or
 statutory.
 Art. 1250
       Such subrogation is conventional:
       1° Where a creditor receiving his payment from a third person subrogates him to his rights, actions, prior charges or
 mortgages against the debtor: that subrogation must be express and made at the same time as the payment;
       2° Where a debtor borrows a sum for the purpose of paying his debt, and of subrogating the lender to the rights of
 the creditor. In order that this subrogation be valid, the instrument of loan and the receipt must be drawn up before
 notaires ; in the instrument of loan there must be declared that the sum was borrowed in order to make the payment,
 and in the receipt, there must be declared that the payment has been made from the funds furnished for this purpose by
 the new creditor. That subrogation has its effect without the concurrence of the wish of the creditor.
 Art. 1251
       Subrogation takes place by operation of law:
       1° For the benefit of the person who, being himself a creditor, pays another creditor who is preferred to him by
 reason of his prior charges or mortgages;
       2° For the benefit of the purchaser of an immovable, who employs the price of his purchase for the payment of the
 creditors to whom that property was mortgaged;
       3° For the benefit of the person who, being bound with others or for others to the payment of a debt, was interested
 in discharging it;
       4° For the benefit of a beneficiary heir who paid from his own funds the debts of a succession.
 Art. 1252
       The subrogation established by the preceding Articles takes place, as well against sureties as against debtors: it
 may not prejudice a creditor where he has only been paid in part; in that case, he may enforce his rights, for what
 remains due to him, in preference to the person from whom he received only part payment.
                                Paragraph 3
                                Of Appropriation of Payments
 Art. 1253
 Articles 1253 to 1256
       A debtor of several debts has the right to declare, when he pays, what debt he intends to discharge.
 Art. 1254
       A debtor of a debt which bears interest or produces arrears , may not, without the consent of the creditor,
 appropriate the payment which he makes to the capital in preference to the arrears or interest: a payment made on
 capital and interest, but which is not in full, shall be appropriated first to interest.
 Art. 1255
       Where a debtor of various debts has accepted a receipt by which the creditor has appropriated what he received to
 one of those debts in particular, the debtor may no longer request appropriation to a different debt, unless there has
 been deception or trick on the part of the creditor.
 Art. 1256
       Where a receipt does not bear any appropriation, the payment shall be appropriated to the debt which the debtor
 had at that time the greatest interest in discharging among those which are likewise due; otherwise, to the debt due,
 although less burdensome than those which are not.
       Where the debts are of equal nature, appropriation shall be made to the oldest; all things being equal, it shall be
 made proportionately.
                                Paragraph 4
                                Of Tenders of Payment and of Deposit
 Art. 1257
 Articles 1257 to 1265 to
 1270
       Where a creditor refuses to receive his payment, the debtor may make him an actual tender, and upon the refusal of
 the creditor to accept it, deposit the sum or the thing tendered.
       Actual tenders followed by a deposit discharge the debtor; they take the place of payment with respect to him,
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 157/268

 where they are validly made, and the thing thus deposited remains at the risk of the creditor.
 Art. 1258
       In order that an actual tender be valid, it is necessary:
       1° That it be made to a creditor having capacity to receive, or to the one who has authority to receive for him;
       2° That it be made by a person capable of paying;
       3° That it be for the entire sum due, for the arrears or interest due, for liquidated costs, and for a sum for
 non-liquidated costs, subject to its being made up;
       4° That the term have elapsed, where it was stipulated in favour of the creditor;
       5° That the condition under which the debt has been contracted has happened;
       6° That the tender be made at the place agreed  upon for payment and that, where there is no special agreement as
 to the place of payment, it be made either to the person of the creditor, or at his domicile, or at the domicile elected for
 performance of the agreement;
       7° That the tender be made by a ministerial officer having capacity for such acts.
 Art. 1259
       [repealed]
 Art. 1260
       The costs of an actual tender and of a deposit are borne by the creditor, where they are valid;
 Art. 1261
       So long as the deposit has not be accepted by the creditor, the debtor may withdraw it; and where he withdraws it,
 his co-debtors or his sureties are not discharged.
 Art. 1262
       Where a debtor has himself obtained a judgment become res judicata, which has declared his tender and deposit
 good and valid, he may no longer, even with the consent of the creditor, withdraw his deposit to the detriment of his
 co-debtors or of his sureties.
 Art. 1263
       A creditor who has consented to the debtor's withdrawing his deposit after it had been declared valid by a judgment
 become res judicata, may no longer, for the payment of his claim, enforce the prior charges and mortgages which
 attached thereto: he has only a mortgage from the day when the act by which he has consented to the withdrawal of the
 deposit has been clothed with the  forms required to establish a mortgage.
 Art. 1264
       Where the thing owed is a thing certain which must be delivered at the place where it is, the debtor must demand of
 the creditor that he removes it, by notice served upon him personally or to his domicile or to the domicile elected for the
 performance of the agreement. That demand made, where the creditor does nor remove the thing and the debtor needs
 the place in which it is set, he may obtain from the court permission to deposit it in some other place.
 Art. 1265 to 1270
       [repealed]
 Art. 1271
                        SECTION II
                        Of Novation
       Novation is brought about in three ways:
 Articles 1271 to 1281
       1° Where a debtor contracts towards his creditor a new debt which is substituted for the old one, which is
 extinguished;
       2° Where a new debtor is substituted for the old one who is discharged by the creditor;
       3° Where, by the effect of a new undertaking, a new creditor is substituted for the old one, towards whom the debtor
 is discharged.
 Art. 1272
       Novation may be brought about only between persons capable of contracting.
 Art. 1273
       Novation may not be presumed; the wish to bring it about must clearly result from the instrument.
 Art. 1274
       Novation by substitution of a new debtor may be brought about without the assistance of the first debtor.
 Art. 1275
       A delegation by which a debtor gives a creditor another debtor who binds himself towards the creditor, does not
 bring about a novation, unless the creditor has expressly declared that he intended to discharge his debtor who made
 the delegation.
 Art. 1276
       A creditor who has discharged a debtor by whom a delegation was made, has no remedy against that debtor, where
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 158/268
CIVIL CODE
 the delegate becomes insolvent, unless the instrument contains an express reserve or the delegate was already [under
 a judicial arrangement], or insolvent at the time of the delegation.
 Art. 1277
       A mere indication, made by a debtor, of a person who is to pay in his stead, does not bring about a novation.
       It shall be likewise as to a mere indication made by a creditor, of a person who is to receive for him.
 Art. 1278
       Prior charges and mortgages of a former claim do not pass to the one which is substituted to it, unless the creditor
 has expressly reserved them.
 Art. 1279
       Where novation is brought about by substitution of a new debtor, the original prior charges and mortgages of the
 claim do not pass on the property of the new debtor.
       (Act no 71-579 of 16 July 1971) The original prior charges and mortgages of the claim may be reserved with the
 consent of the owners of the encumbered property, for the guarantee of the performance of the undertaking of the new
 debtor.
 Art. 1280
       Where novation is brought about between a creditor and one of the joint and several debtors, the prior charges and
 mortgages of the former claim may be reserved only on the property of the person who contracts the new debt.
 Art. 1281
       Co-debtors are released by a novation made between a creditor and one of the joint and several debtors.
       A novation brought about with respect to a principal debtor discharges the sureties.
       Nevertheless, where a creditor in the first case, has required adhesion of the co-debtors or, in the second case, that
 of the sureties, the former claim subsists, where the co-debtors or the sureties refuse to agree to the new arrangement.
                        SECTION III
                        Of Remission of Debt
 Art. 1282
 Articles 1282 to 1288
       A voluntary remittance of the original instrument under private signature, by a creditor to a debtor, is proof of
 discharge.
 Art. 1283
       A voluntary remittance of the executory copy of the instrument of title establishes a presumption of remission of the
 debt or of payment, without prejudice to proof of the contrary.
 Art. 1284
       A voluntary remittance of the original instrument under private signature, or of the executory copy of the instrument
 of title, to one of the joint and several debtors, has the same effect for the benefit of his co-debtors.
 Art. 1285
       A remission or agreed discharge for the benefit of one of the joint and several co-debtors releases all the others,
 unless the creditor has expressly reserved his rights against the latter.
       In that last case, he may recover the debt only after deducting the share of the one to whom he has made the
 remission.
 Art. 1286
       A remittance of a thing given as "pawn or" (Ord. no 2006-346 of 23 March 2006) pledge does not suffice to establish
 a presumption of remission of debt.
 Art. 1287
       A remission or agreed discharge granted to a principal debtor releases the sureties;
       That granted to a surety does not release the principal debtor;
       That granted to one of the sureties does not release the others.
 Art. 1288
       What a creditor has received from a surety to discharge his security shall be appropriated to the debt, and turn to
 the discharge of the principal debtor and of the other sureties.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Set-Off
 Art. 1289
 Articles 1289 to 1299
       Where two persons are indebted to each other, set-off is brought about between them and both debts are
 extinguished, in the manner and in the cases hereafter laid down.
 Art. 1290
       Set-off is brought about as of right by the sole operation of the law, even without the knowledge of the debtors; the
 two debts are reciprocally extinguished, from the moment when they happen to exist at the same time, to the extent of
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 159/268
CIVIL CODE
 their respective amounts.
 Art. 1291
       Set-off takes place only between two debts which have likewise as their object a sum of  money or a certain quantity
 of fungibles of the same kind and which are likewise liquid and due. 
       Performances in crops or commodities which are undisputed and whose price is fixed by market lists, may be set off
 against liquid and due sums.
 Art. 1292
       Days of grace are not a bar to set-off.
 Art. 1293
       Set-off takes place whatever the origin of either debt may be, except in the case:
       1° Of a claim for restitution of a thing of which the owner has been unjustly deprived;
       2° Of a claim for restitution of a deposit or of a loan for use;
       3° Of a debt due for maintenance declared not liable to attachment.
 Art. 1294
       A surety may raise set-off for what the creditor owes to the principal debtor.
       But a principal debtor may not raise set-off for what the creditor owes to the surety. 
       Similarly, a joint and several debtor may not raise set-off for what the creditor owes to his co-     debtor.
 Art. 1295
       A debtor who has accepted outright the assignment which a creditor made of his rights to a third party may no
 longer raise against the assignee a set-off which he might have raised against the assignor before the acceptance.
       With regard to an assignment which was not accepted by the debtor, but notice of which has been served upon him,
 it prevents only set-off as to claims subsequent to that notice
 Art. 1296
       Where the two debts are not payable at the same place, set-off may be raised only by giving satisfaction as to the
 costs of delivery.
 Art. 1297
       Where several debts due by the same person may be set off , the same rules are followed as to set-off as those
 established for appropriation by Article 1256.
 Art. 1298
       Set-off may not take place to the detriment of the vested rights of third parties. Thus, a person who, being a debtor,
 has become a creditor after an attachment has been made in his hands by a third party may not raise set-off to the
 detriment of the attaching party.
 Art. 1299
       He who has paid a debt which was extinguished as of right by set-off may no longer, by enforcing the claim for
 which he has not raised set-off, avail himself of the prior charges or mortgages attached thereto, to the detriment of third
 parties, unless he had good reason for not being aware of the claim which would have set off his debt.
                        SECTION V
                        Of Merger
 Art. 1300
 Articles 1300 to 1301
       Where the capacities of creditor and debtor are united in the same person, a merger is made as of right which
 extinguishes both claims.
 Art. 1301
       A merger which is brought about in the person of a principal debtor benefits his sureties;
       That which is brought about in the person of a surety does not involve extinguishment of the principal obligation ;
       That which is brought about in the person of a creditor, benefits his joint and several co-debtors only as to the share
 and portion of which he was debtor.
                        SECTION VI
                        Of the Loss of a Thing Due
 Art. 1302
 Articles 1302 to 1303
       Where a thing certain and determined which was the object of an obligation perishes, may no longer be the subject
 matter of legal transactions between private individuals, or is lost in such a way that its existence is absolutely unknown,
 the obligation is extinguished if the thing has perished or has been lost without the fault of the debtor, and before he was
 under notice of default.
       Even where the debtor is under notice of default, if he has not assumed fortuitous events, the obligation is
 extinguished in the case where the thing would also have perished in the hands of the creditor if it had been delivered to
 him.
       The debtor is obliged to prove the fortuitous event which he alleges.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 160/268
CIVIL CODE
       In whatever manner a thing which has been stolen may have perished, or been lost, its loss does not excuse the
 person who took it away from restitution of its price.
 Art. 1303
       Where a thing perishes, may no longer be the subject matter of legal transactions between private individuals, or is
 lost, without the fault of the debtor, he is obliged, if there are any rights or actions for indemnity with respect to that thing,
 to assign them to his creditor.
                        SECTION VII
                        Of the Action for Annulment or Rescission of Agreements
 Art. 1304
 (Act no 68-05 of 3 Jan . 1968)
 Articles 1304 to 1314
       In all cases where an action for annulment or rescission of an agreement is not limited to a shorter time by a special
 statute, that action lasts five years.
       In case of duress, that time runs only from the day when it has ceased; in case of error or deception, from the day
 when they were discovered.
       As regards transactions entered into by a minor, the time runs only from the day of majority or emancipation; and as
 regards transactions entered into by a protected adult, from the day when he had knowledge of them, while being in a
 situation to validly redo them. It runs against the heirs of a person under a disability only from the day of the death,
 unless it has begun to run previously.
 Art. 1305
 (Act no 64-1230 of 14 Dec. 1964)
       A mere loss gives rise to rescission in favour of a non-emancipated minor, with respect to all kinds of agreements.
 Art. 1306
       A minor is not entitled to rescission on the ground of loss, where it results only from a casual and unforeseen event.
 Art. 1307
       -A mere declaration of majority, made by a minor, is not a bar to rescission.
 Art. 1308
 (Act no 74-631 of 5 July 1974)
       A minor who practises a profession is not entitled to rescission against undertakings which he has taken upon
 himself in the practice thereof.
 Art. 1309
       A minor is not entitled to rescission against the terms contained in his ante-nuptial agreement where they were
 made with the consent and assistance of those whose consent is required for the validity of his marriage.
 Art. 1310
       He is not entitled to rescission against the obligations resulting from his intentional or unintentional wrongs.
 Art. 1311
       He is no longer allowed to repudiate an undertaking which he had entered into during his minority where he has
 ratified it when an adult, whether that undertaking was void in its form, or only subject to rescission.
 Art. 1312
 (Act of 18 Feb. 1938)
       Where minors or adults in guardianship are entitled in those capacities to rescission against their undertakings, the
 repayment of what may have been paid during the minority or the guardianship of adults in consequence of those
 undertakings, may not be demanded, unless it is proved that what has been paid has turned to their benefit.
 Art. 1313
       Adults are entitled to rescission for loss only in the cases and subject to the conditions specially laid down in this
 Code.
 Art. 1314
       Where the formalities required with regard to minors or adults in guardianship either for the conveyance of an
 immovable, or for the partition of a succession, have been fulfilled, they shall be, in relation to those transactions,
 considered as though they had made them during majority or before the guardianship of adults.
                CHAPTER VI
                Of the Proof of Obligations and of Payment
 Art. 1315
       A person who claims the performance of an obligation must prove it.
 Articles 1316 to 1315-1
       Reciprocally, a person who claims to be released must substantiate the payment or the fact which has produced the
 extinguishment of his obligation.
 Art. 1315-1
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 161/268
CIVIL CODE
 (Act no 2000-230 of 13 March 2000)
       The rules relating to documentary evidence, oral evidence, presumptions, admissions of parties and oaths are
 explained in the following Sections.
                        SECTION I
                        Of Documentary Evidence
                                Paragraph 1
                                General Provisions
 Art. 1316
 Articles 1316 to 1340
 Articles 1316 to 1316-4
       Documentary evidence, or evidence in writing, results from a sequence of letters, characters, figures or of any other
 signs or symbols having an intelligible meaning, whatever their medium and the ways and means of their transmission
 may be.
 Art. 1316-1
       A writing in electronic form is admissible as evidence in the same manner as a paper-based writing, provided that
 the person from whom it proceeds can be duly identified and that it be established and stored in conditions calculated to
 secure its integrity.
 Art. 1316-2
       Where a statute has not fixed other principles, and failing a valid agreement to the contrary between the parties, the
 judge shall regulate the conflicts in matters of documentary evidence by determining by every means the most credible
 instrument, whatever its medium may be.
 Art. 1316-3
       An electronic-based writing has the same probative value as a  paper-based writing.
 Art. 1316-4
       The signature necessary to the execution of a legal transaction identifies the person who apposes it. It makes clear
 the consent of the parties to the obligations which flow from that transaction. When it is apposed by a public officer, it
 confers authenticity to the document.
       Where it is electronic, it consists in a reliable process of identifying which safeguards its link with the instrument to
 which it relates. The reliability of that process shall be presumed, until proof to the contrary, where an electronic
 signature is created, the identity of the signatory secured and the integrity of the instrument safeguarded, subject to the
 conditions laid down by decree in Conseil d’État.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of Authentic Instruments
 Art. 1317
 Articles 1317 to 1321-1
       An authentic instrument is one which has been received by public officers empowered to draw up such instruments
 at the place where the instrument was written and with the requisite formalities.
       (Act no 2000-230 of 13 March 2000) It may be drawn up on an electronic medium where it is established and stored
 in conditions fixed by decree in Conseil d’État.
 Art. 1318
       An instrument which is not authentic because of the lack of power or incapacity of the officer, or of a defect in form,
 has the value of a private instrument, if it was signed by the parties.
 Art. 1319
       An authentic instrument is conclusive evidence of the agreement it contains between the contracting parties and
 their heirs or assigns.
       Nevertheless in case of a criminal complaint for forgery, the execution of the instrument allegedly  forged is
 suspended by the indictment; and in case of allegation of forgery made incidentally, the courts may, according to the
 circumstances, suspend temporarily the execution of the instrument.
 Art. 1320
       An instrument, either authentic, or under private signature, is evidence between the parties, even of what is
 expressed only in declaratory terms, provided the declaration has a direct connection with the operative part.
 Declarations irrelevant to the operative part may only be used as a commencement of proof.
 Art. 1321
       Counter letters may be effective only between the contracting parties; they may not be effective against third
 parties.
 Article 1321-1
 (Ord. no 2005-1512 of 7 Dec. 2005)
       Is void and of no effect a counter letter whose purpose is an increase in the price stipulated in the agreement of
 transfer of an office ministériel and any contract whose purpose is to conceal part of the selling price of an immovable or
 the price of the transfer of business assets or of a goodwill or of the transfer of a right to a lease or of the benefit of an
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 162/268
CIVIL CODE
 undertaking to lease relating to the whole or part of an immovable and the whole or part of the balance of a barter or of a
 partition including immovables, business assets or a goodwill.
                                Paragraph 3
                                Of Instruments under Private Signature
 Art. 1322
 Articles 1322 to 1332
       An instrument under private signature, acknowledged by the person against whom it is set up, or statutorily held as
 acknowledged, is, between those who have signed it and between their heirs and assigns, as conclusive as an authentic
 instrument.
 Art. 1323
       A person against whom an instrument under private signature is set up is obliged to formally admit or disclaim his
 handwriting or his signature.
       His heirs or assigns may confine themselves to declare that they are not aware of the handwriting or the signature
 of their predecessor in title.
 Art. 1324
       In the case where the party disclaims his handwriting or his signature, and in the case where his heirs or assigns
 declare that they are not aware of them, a verification shall be ordered in court.
 Art. 1325
       Instruments under private signature which contain synallagmatic agreements are valid only insofar as they have
 been made in as many originals as there are parties having a distinct interest.
       One original suffices for all the persons who have the same interest.
       Each original must indicate the number of originals which have been made.
       Nevertheless, a failure to mention that the originals have been made in duplicate, triplicate, etc., may not be set up
 by the party who has performed on his part the agreement entered  on the instrument.
       (Ord. no 2005-674 of 16 June 2005) The requirement of a plurality of originals  is deemed to be met with respect to
 contracts in electronic form where the instrument is established and stored as provided in Articles 1316-1 and 1316-4
 and the process allows each party to dispose of a copy or have access thereto.
 Art. 1326
 (Act no 80-525 of 12July 1980)
       The legal transaction by which one party alone undertakes towards another to pay him a sum of money or to deliver
 him a fungible must be ascertained in an instrument which carries the signature of the person who subscribes that
 undertaking as well as the mention, written “by himself” (Act no 2000-230 of 13 March 2000), of the sum or of the
 quantity in full and in figures. In case of difference, the instrument under private signature is valid for the sum written in
 full.
 Art. 1327
       [repealed]
 Art. 1328
       Instruments under private signature have a date against third parties only from the day when they have been
 registered, from the day of the death of the one or one of those who have signed them, or from the date when their gist
 is established in instruments drawn up by public officers, such as memoranda of sealing or of inventory.
 Art. 1329
       The registers of merchants are not evidence of the supplies therein mentioned against  persons who are not
 merchant, except for what will be stated with regard to oaths.
 Art. 1330
       The books of merchants are evidence against them; but he who wishes to take advantage from them may not
 separate from them what they contain contrary to his claim.
 Art. 1331
       Family registers and papers do not constitute an instrument of title for the one who wrote them. They are evidence
 against him: 1° in all cases where they formally state a payment received ; 2° where they contain an express mention
 that the entry has been made to make good a defect of the instrument in favour of the person in whose benefit they state
 an obligation.
 Art. 1332
       A writing made by a creditor at the end, in the margin or on the back of an instrument who has always remained in
 his possession, is evidence, although not signed or dated by him, where it tends to establish the discharge of the debtor.
       It shall be likewise with a writing made by a creditor on the back, or in the margin, or at the end of the duplicate of
 an instrument or of a receipt, provided that duplicate is in the hands of the debtor.
                                Paragraph 4
                                Of Tallies
 Article 1333
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 163/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1333
       Tallies corresponding to their samples are evidence between persons who are in the practice of thus establishing
 the supplies they furnish or receive in retail.
                                Paragraph 5
                                Of Copies of Instruments
 Art. 1334
 Articles 1334 to 1336
       Where the original instrument is still extant, copies are evidence only of what is contained in the instrument, whose
 production may always be required.
 Art. 1335
       Where the original instrument no longer exists, copies are evidence according to the following distinctions:
       1° Executory or first office copies are evidence as the original is: it shall be likewise with the copies which have been
 made under the authority of the court, the parties being present or duly summoned, or with those which have been made
 in the presence of the parties and by their mutual consent.
       2° Copies which, without the authority of the court or without the consent of the parties and since the delivery of the
 executory or first office copies, have been made from the original of the instrument by the notaire who received it, or by
 one of his successors, or by public officers who, in such capacity, are depositaries of the originals, may, in case or loss
 of the original, be evidence when they are ancient.
       They shall be deemed ancient where they are more than thirty years old.
       Where they are less than thirty years old, they may only be used as a commencement of proof in writing.
       3° Where the copies made from the original of an instrument were done by the notaire who received it, or by one of
 his successors, or by public officers who, in such capacity, are depositaries of the originals, they may be used, however
 ancient they may be, only as a commencement of proof in writing.
       4° Copies of copies may, according to the circumstances, be considered as mere information.
 Art. 1336
       The registration of an instrument on public registers may only be used as a commencement of proof in writing; and
 even for that purpose it shall be necessary :
       1° That it be certain that all the originals of the notaire, of the year in which the instrument appears to have been
 made, are lost, or that one proves that the loss of the original occurred through a particular accident;
       2° That there exist an orderly list of the notaire, which establishes that the instrument was made at the same date.
       Where, owing to the concurrence of these two circumstances oral evidence is admitted, those who were witnesses
 to the instrument shall be heard, if they are still alive.
                                Paragraph 6
                                Of Instruments of Recognition and of Confirmation
 Art. 1337
 Articles 1337 to 1340
       Instruments of recognition do not relieve from the production of the original instrument, unless its terms are specially
 stated therein.
       What they may contain in addition to the original instrument, or what is different therein, has no effect.
       Nevertheless, where there are several consistent recognitions, supported by possession, and of which one dates
 back thirty years, the creditor may be relieved from producing the original instrument.
 Art. 1338
       An instrument of confirmation or ratification of an obligation against which legislation allows an action for annulment
 or rescission is valid only where are found therein the gist of that obligation, mention of the ground of the action for
 rescission, and the intention to cure the defect upon which that action is based.
       Failing an instrument of confirmation or ratification, it is sufficient that the obligation be performed voluntarily after
 the time when the obligation might be validly performed or ratified.
       Confirmation, ratification, or voluntary performance in the forms and at the time determined by law, implies waiver of
 the grounds and exceptions which might be raised against that instrument, without prejudice however to the rights of
 third parties.
 Art. 1339
       A donor may not cure by any act of confirmation the defects of a gift inter vivos, void as to form: it must be remade
 in the form prescribed by law.
 Art. 1340
       Confirmation or ratification, or voluntary performance of a gift by the heirs or assigns of a donor, after his death,
 implies that they waive their right to raise either the defects in form or any other defences.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Oral Evidence
 Art. 1341
 (Act no 80-525 of 12 July 1980)
 Articles 1341 to 1348
       An instrument before notaires or under private signature must be executed in all matters exceeding a sum or value
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 164/268
CIVIL CODE
 fixed by decree1, even for voluntary deposits, and no proof by witness is allowed against or beyond the contents of
 instruments, or as to what is alleged to have been said before, at the time of, or after the instruments, although it is a
 question of a lesser sum or value.
       All of which without prejudice to what is prescribed in the statutes relating to commerce.
       1 D. no 80-533 of 15 July 1980 : 5 000 F (800 €)
 Art. 1342
 (Act no 80-525 of 12 July 1980)
       The above rule shall apply where an action contains, in addition to a claim for capital, a claim for interest which,
 added to the capital, exceeds the figure provided for in the preceding Article.
 Art. 1343
 (Act no 80-525 of 12 July 1980)
       A person who has brought a claim exceeding the figure provided for in Article 1341 may no longer be allowed to
 produce oral evidence, even by reducing his original claim.
 Art. 1344
 (Act no 80-525 of 12 July 1980)
       Oral evidence may not be allowed on a claim for a sum even lesser than that which is provided for in Article 1341,
 where that sum is declared to be the balance or to form part of a larger claim which is not proved in writing.
 Art. 1345
 (Act no 80-525 of 12 July 1980)
       Where, in the same proceedings, a party asserts several claims for which he has no written instrument, and where,
 joined together, they exceed the sum provided for in Article 1341, oral evidence of them may not be allowed, although
 the party alleges that those claims come from different origins and that they were formed at different times, unless those
 rights are derived from succession, gift or otherwise, from different persons.
 Art. 1346
       All claims, whatever their ground may be, which are not fully justified in writing, shall be brought by the same
 process, after which the other claims of which there is no written evidence may not be received.
 Art. 1347
       The above rules are subject to exception where there exists a commencement of proof in writing.
       Is so called any instrument in writing which emanates from the person against whom a claim is brought, or from the
 person he represents, and which makes probable the alleged fact.
       (Act no 75-596 of 9 July 1975) May be considered by the judge as equivalent to a commencement of proof in writing
 the declarations made by a party at the time of his personal examination, his refusal to answer or his absence at the
 examination . 
Art. 1348
 (Act no 80-525 of 12 July 1980)
       The above rules are also subject to exceptions where the obligation arises from a quasi-contract, an intentional or
 unintentional wrong, or where one of the parties either did not have the material or moral possibility to procure a written
 proof of a legal transaction, or has lost the instrument which served him as written proof in consequence of a fortuitous
 event or of  force majeure.
       They are also subject to exceptions where a party or a depositary has not kept the original instrument and presents
 a copy which is a reproduction that is not only faithful but also  enduring. Is deemed enduring an indelible reproduction
 of the original which involves a non-reversible alteration of  the medium.
                        SECTION III
                        Of Presumptions
 Art. 1349
 Articles 1350 to 1349
       Presumptions are the consequences that a statute or the court draws from a known fact to an unknown fact.
                                Paragraph 1
                                Of Presumptions Established by Statute
 Art. 1350
 Articles 1350 to 1352
       A statutory presumption is one which is attached by a special statute to certain transactions or to certain facts; such
 as:
       1° The transactions which a statute declares void, as presumed made in fraud of its provisions, from their nature
 alone;
       2° The cases in which a statute declares ownership or discharge to result from certain determined circumstances;
       3° The authority which law gives to res judicata;
       4° The force which law attaches to an admission of a party or to his oath.
 Art. 1351
       The force of res judicata  takes place only with respect to what was the subject matter of a judgment. It is necessary
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 165/268
CIVIL CODE
 that the thing claimed be the same; that the claim be based on the same grounds; that the claim be between the same
 parties and brought by them and against them in the same capacity.
 Art. 1352
       A statutory presumption dispenses from any proof him in whose favour it exists.
       No proof is allowed against a statutory presumption, where, on the basis of such presumption, the law annuls
 certain transactions or denies a right of action, unless it reserves contrary evidence and subject to what will be said on
 judicial oath and admissions.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of Presumptions Which are not Established by Statute
 Art. 1353
 Article 1353
       The presumptions which are not established by a statute are left to the insight and carefulness of the judges, who
 shall only admit serious, precise and concurrent presumptions, and in the cases only where statutes admit oral
 evidence, unless a transaction is attacked for reason of fraud or deception.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Admissions of a Party
 Art. 1354
       An admission which is set up against a party is either extra-judicial or judicial.
 Art. 1355
 Articles 1354 to 1356
       An allegation of an extra-judicial admission which is purely verbal is useless whenever the claim is one in which oral
 evidence would not be admissible.
 Art. 1356
       A judicial admission is a declaration which a party or his special agent makes in court.
       It is conclusive evidence against him who made it;
       It may not be divided against him;
       It may not be revoked, unless it is proved that it was the result of an error of fact. It might not be revoked under the
 pretext of an error of law.
                        SECTION V
                        Of Oaths
 Art. 1357
       A judicial oath is of two kinds :
 Articles 1358 to 1357
       1° The one which a party tenders to the other in order to make the judgment of the case depend upon it: it is called
 decisive ;
       2° The one which is tendered by the judge of his own motion to one or another of the parties.
                                Paragraph 1
                                Of Decisive Oaths
 Art. 1358
       A decisive oath may be tendered in any kind of controversies whatsoever.
 Art. 1359
       It may be tendered only as to a fact which is personal to the party to whom it is tendered.
 Art. 1360
 Articles 1358 to 1365
       It may be tendered at all stages of the case and although there exists no commencement of proof in writing of the
 claim or of the defence in relation to which it is instigated.
 Art. 1361
       A person to whom an oath is tendered, who refuses it or does not consent to tender it back to his opponent, or an
 opponent to whom it has been tendered back and who refuses it, shall be defeated in his claim or in his defence.
 Art. 1362
       An oath may not be tendered back where the fact to which it relates does not concern both parties, but is purely
 personal to the one to whom the oath was tendered.
 Art. 1363
       Where an oath tendered or tendered back has been taken, the opponent is not admitted to prove the falsity of it.
 Art. 1364
       The party who has tendered or tendered back an oath may no longer retract where the opponent has declared that
 he is ready to take the oath.
 Art. 1365
       An oath is evidence only for the benefit of the person who has tendered it or against him, and for the benefit of his
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 166/268
CIVIL CODE
 heirs and assigns or against them.
       Nevertheless an oath tendered by one of the joint and several creditors to a debtor discharges the latter only for the
 share of that creditor;
       An oath tendered to a principal debtor discharges also the sureties;
       The one tendered to one of the joint and several debtors benefits the co-debtors;
       And the one tendered to a surety benefits the principal debtor.
       In the last two cases, the oath of a joint and several co-debtor or of a surety benefits the other co-debtors or the
 principal debtor only where it has been tendered in connection with the debt, and not with the circumstance of the joint
 and several liability or of the security.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of Oaths Tendered by a Judge of his Own Motion
 Art. 1366
 Articles 1366 to 1369
       A judge may tender an oath to one of the party, in order either to make the decision of the case depend upon it, or
 only to fix the amount of the order.
 Art. 1367
       A judge may tender an oath of his own motion, with reference either to a claim or to a defence set up against it, only
 subject to the following two conditions; it is necessary:
       1° That the claim or the defence be not fully substantiated;
       2° That it be not wholly deprived of proof.
       Outside those two cases, the judge must either admit or dismiss the claim outright.
 Art. 1368
       An oath tendered by the judge of his own motion to one of the parties may not be tendered back by that party to the
 other.
 Art. 1369
       An oath as to the value of a thing claimed may be tendered by the judge to the plaintiff only where it is otherwise
 impossible to establish that value.
       Even in that case, the judge must determine the sum up to the amount of which the plaintiff shall be believed on his
 oath.
                CHAPTER VII
                Of Contracts in Electronic Form
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Exchange of Information in case of a Contract in Electronic Form
 Article 1369-1
 Articles 1369-1 to
 1369-11
 Articles 1369-1 to
 1369-3
       Electronic means may be resorted to in order to render contractual terms or information regarding goods or services
 available.
 Article 1369-2
       Information which is requested for the purpose of concluding a contract or that which is addressed during its
 performance may be transmitted by electronic mail where their addressee has accepted the use of this means.
 Article 1369-3
       Information aimed at a professional may be addressed to him by electronic mail when he has communicated his
 electronic address.
       Where this information must be entered in a form, the latter one must be made available to the person who has to
 fill it up, by electronic means.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Conclusion of a Contract in Electronic Form
 Art. 1369-4
 Articles 1369-4 to
 1369-6
       Any person who, in a professional capacity, by electronic means, proposes the delivery of goods or the provision of
 services, shall make available the applicable contract terms in a way that allows their filing and reproduction. Without
 prejudice to the conditions of validity specified in the offer, his author shall remain bound by it so long as it is available by
 electronic means of his own accord.
       The offer shall also state:
       1° The different steps to follow to conclude the contract by electronic means;
       2° The technical means allowing the user to identify and correct input errors before the conclusion of the contract;
       3° The languages offered for the conclusion of the contract;
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 167/268
CIVIL CODE
       4° In case of filing of the contract, the details of this filing by the author of the offer and the conditions of access to
 the filed contract;
       5° The ways of consulting by electronic means the professional and commercial rules by which the author of the
 offer has the intention to be bound, should the occasion arise. 
Art. 1369-5
       For the valid conclusion of a contract, the recipient of the offer must have had the possibility of checking the
 particulars of his order and its whole price, and of correcting  possible errors, before confirming it in order to express his
 acceptance.
       The author of the offer shall acknowledge without undue delay and by electronic means the receipt of the order
 which has been addressed to him in this way. 
       The order, the confirmation of the acceptance of the offer and the acknowledgement of receipt must be deemed
 received when the parties to whom they are addressed are able to access  them.
 Art. 1369-6
       Exception is made to the obligations referred to in Article 1369-1, 1° to 5°, and in Article 1369-2, paragraphs 1 and
 2, in regard to the contracts for the delivery of goods or the provision of services which are concluded exclusively by
 exchange of electronic mail.
       Furthermore, it is permissible to derogate from the provisions of Article 1369-2 and of Article 1369-1, 1° to 5°, in the
 contracts concluded between professionals. 
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Sending or Delivering of a Writing by Electronic Means
 Article 1369-7
 Articles 1369-7 to
 1369-9
       An ordinary letter relating to the conclusion or performance of a contract may be sent by electronic mail.
       The appending of the date of sending shall result from an electronic process whose reliability is presumed, until
 evidence contrary to it, where it meets the requirements fixed by decree in Conseil d'Etat.
 Article 1369-8
       A charged letter relating to the conclusion or performance of a contract may be sent by electronic mail provided that
 this mail is dispatched by a third person according to a process which allows to identify that third person, to designate
 the sender, to ensure the identity of the addressee and to establish whether the letter has been delivered or not to the
 addressee.
       At the option of the sender, the contents of that letter may be printed by the third person on paper in order to be
 delivered to the addressee or may be addressed to the latter by electronic means. In the latter case, where the
 addressee is not a professional, he must have requested the sending by that way or have accepted the use of it during
 previous exchanges.
       Where the appending of the date of sending or of receipt results from an electronic process, the reliability of the
 latter is presumed, until evidence contrary to it, where it meets the requirements fixed by decree in Conseil d'Etat.
       An advice of delivery may be addressed to the sender by electronic means or by any other device which allows him
 to store it.
       The details of implementation of this Article shall be fixed by decree in Conseil d'Etat.
 Article 1369-9
       Apart from the cases provided for in Articles 1369-1 and 1369-2, the delivery of a writing in electronic form is actual
 where the addressee, after being able to make himself acquainted with it, has given advice of its delivery.
       Where a provision sets out that a writing must be read to the addressee, the delivery of an electronic writing to the
 party concerned in the way provided for in paragraph 1 is deemed to be reading .
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Certain Requirements as to Form
 Article 1369-10
 Articles 1369-10 to
 1369-11
       Where a writing on paper is subject to certain requirements as to legibility and arrangement, a writing in electronic
 form shall meet equivalent requirements.
       The requirement of a detachable form is met by an electronic process which allows to have access to the form and
 send it back by the same means.
 Article 1369-11
       The requirement of a sending in several copies is deemed to be met in electronic form where the writing may be
 printed by the addressee.
        TITLE IV
        OF UNDERTAKINGS FORMED WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT
 Art. 1370
 Articles 1371 to 1370
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 168/268
CIVIL CODE
       Certain undertakings are formed without the intervention of any agreement, either on the part of him who binds
 himself, or on the part of him towards whom he is bound.
       Some of them result from the sole authority of legislation; others arise from an act personal to the one who is
 obligated.
       The former are the undertakings formed involuntarily, such as those between neighbouring owners, or those of
 guardians and other administrators who may not refuse the duties which are imposed upon them.
       Undertakings arising from an act personal to him who is bound result either from quasi- contracts, or from
 intentional or unintentional wrongs; they constitute the subject-matter of this Title . 
                CHAPTER I
                Of Quasi-Contracts
 Art. 1371
 Articles 1371 to 1381
       Quasi-contracts are purely voluntary acts of man, from which there results some undertaking towards a third party,
 and sometimes a reciprocal undertaking of both parties.
 Art. 1372
       Where one voluntarily manages another’s business, whether the owner is aware of the management, or whether he
 is not, he who manages contracts a tacit undertaking to continue the management which he has embarked on, and to
 complete it until the owner is in a position to look after it himself; he must also take charge of all the continuations of that
 business.
       He is then subject to all the obligations which would result from an express authority which the owner might have
 confided to him.
 Art. 1373
       He is bound to continue his management, although the owner  happens to die before the business is achieved , until
 a heir is able to take over the business.
 Art. 1374
       He is bound to bring to the management of the business all the care of a prudent administrator.
       Nevertheless, the circumstances which have led him to take the responsibility of the business may authorize the
 judge to restrain the damages which would result from the faults or negligent conduct of the manager.
 Art. 1375
       The owner whose business has been well managed must fulfil the undertakings which the manager has contracted
 in his name, indemnify him for all the personal undertakings into which he has entered and reimburse him for all the
 useful or necessary expenses which he has incurred.
 Art. 1376
       He who receives by error or knowingly what is not owed to him is bound to make restitution to the person from
 whom he has unduly received it.
 Art. 1377
       Where a person who, by error, believed himself to be the debtor, pays a debt, he has the right to recovery against
 the creditor.
       Nevertheless, that right ceases where the creditor has cancelled his instrument of title in consequence of the
 payment, subject to the remedy of the person who has paid against the true debtor.
 Art. 1378
       Where there has been bad faith on the part of the person who received, he is bound to make restitution, of the
 capital as well as of interest or fruits, from the day of payment.
 Art. 1379
       Where the thing unduly received is an immovable or a tangible movable, the person who has received it binds
 himself to make restitution in kind, if it exists, or of its value, if it has perished or deteriorated through his fault; he is even
 guarantor of its loss by fortuitous event, if he received it in bad faith.
 Art. 1380
       Where the person who received in good faith has sold the thing, he must make restitution only of the proceeds of
 the sale.
 Art. 1381
       The person to whom a thing is restored must account, even to a possessor in bad faith, of all the necessary and
 useful expenses which have been incurred for the preservation of the thing.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Intentional and Unintentional Wrongs [Of Torts]
 Art. 1382
 Articles 1382 to 1386
       Any act whatever of man, which causes damage to another, obliges the one by whose fault it occurred, to
 compensate it.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 169/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1383
       Everyone is liable for the damage he causes not only by his intentional act, but also by his negligent conduct or by
 his imprudence.
 Art. 1384
       A person is liable not only for the damages he causes by his own act, but also for that which is caused by the acts
 of persons for whom he is responsible, or by things which are  in his custody.
       (Act of 7 Nov. 1922) However, a person who possesses, regardless of the basis thereof,  all or part of a building or
 of movable property in which a fire has originated is not liable towards third parties for damages caused by that fire
 unless it is proved that the fire must be attributed to his fault of to the fault of persons for whom he is responsible.
       (Act of 7 Nov. 1922) This provision may not apply to the landlord and tenant relationship, which remains governed
 by Articles 1733 and 1734 of the Civil Code.
       (Act no 70-459 of 4 June 1970) The father and mother, in so far as they exercise “parental authority” (Act no
 2002-305 of 4 March 2002), are jointly and severally liable for the damage caused by their minor children who live with
 them.
       Masters and employers, for the damage caused by their servants and employees in the functions for which they
 have been employed;
       Teachers and craftsmen, for the damage caused by their pupils and apprentices during the time when they are
 under their supervision.
       (Act of 5 April 1937) The above liability exists, unless the father and mother or the craftsmen prove that they could
 not prevent the act which gives rise to that liability.
       (Act of 5 April 1937) As to teachers, the faults, imprudence or negligent conducts invoked against them as having
 caused the damaging act must be proved by the plaintiff at the trial, in accordance with the general law.
 Art. 1385
       The owner of an animal, or the person using it, during the period of usage, is liable for the damage the animal has
 caused, whether the animal was under his custody, or whether it had strayed or escaped.
 Art. 1386
       The owner of a building is liable for the damage caused by its collapse, where it happens as a result of lack of
 maintenance or of a defect in its construction.
        TITLE IV bis
        OF LIABILITY FOR DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS
 Art. 1386-1
 Articles 1386-1 to
 1386-18
       A producer is liable for damages caused by a defect in his product, whether he was bound by a contract with the
 injured person or not.
 Art. 1386-2
       (Act no 2004-1343 of 9 Dec. 2004).- The provisions of this Title shall apply to compensation for damage caused by
 personal injury.
       They shall apply also to compensation for damage above an amount fixed by décret to an item of property other
 than the defective product itself.
 Art. 1386-3
       A product is any movable, even though incorporated into an immovable, including the products of the soil, of
 stock-farming, of hunting and fishing. Electricity shall be deemed a product.
 Art. 1386-4
       A product is defective within the meaning of this Title where it does not provide the safety which  a person is entitled
 to expect.
       In order to appraise the safety which a person is entitled to expect, regard shall be had to all the circumstances and
 in particular to the presentation of the product, the use to which one could reasonably expect that it would be put, and
 the time when the product was put into circulation.
       A product shall not be considered defective for the sole reason that a better product is subsequently put into
 circulation.
 Art. 1386-5
       A product is put into circulation when the producer has voluntarily parted with it.
       A product is put into circulation only once.
 Art. 1386-6
       Is a producer, the manufacturer of a finished product, the producer of a raw material, the manufacturer of a
 component part, where he acts as a professional.
       For the implementation of this Title, shall be treated in the same way as a producer any person acting as a
 professional:
       1° Who presents himself as the producer by putting his name, trade mark or other distinguishing feature on the

CIVIL CODE
 product;
       2° Who imports a product into the European Community for sale, hire, with or without a promise of sale, or any other
 form of distribution.
       Shall not be deemed producers, within the meaning of this Title, the persons whose liability may be  sought on the
 basis of Articles 1792 to 1792-6 and 1646-1.
 Art. 1386-7
       "A seller, a hirer, with the exception of a finance lessor or a hirer similar to a finance lessor, or any other
 professional supplier is liable for the lack of safety of a product in the same conditions as a producer only if the latter
 remains unknown" (Act no 2004-1343 of 9 Dec. 2004).
       The remedy of a supplier against a producer is subject to the same rules as a claim brought by a direct victim of a
 defect. However, he must take action within the year following the date of his being summoned.
 Art. 1386-8
       In case of damage caused by a product incorporated into another, the producer of the component part and the one
 who has effected the incorporation are jointly and severally liable.
 Art. 1386-9
       The plaintiff is required to prove the damage, the defect and the causal relationship between defect and damage.
 Art. 1386-10
       A producer may be liable for a defect although the product was manufactured in accordance with the rules of the
 trade or of existing standards or although it was the subject of an administrative authorization.
 Art. 1386-11
       A producer is liable as of right unless he proves:
       1° That he did not put the product into circulation;
       2° That, having regard to the circumstances, it is probable that the defect which caused the damage did not exist at
 the time when the product was put into circulation by him or that this defect came into being afterwards;
       3° That the product was not for the purpose of sale or of any other form of distribution;
       4° That the state of scientific and technical knowledge, at the time when he put the product into circulation, was not
 such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered;  or
       5° That the defect is due to compliance with mandatory provisions of statutes or regulations.
       The producer of a component part is not liable either where he proves that the defect is attributable to the design of
 the product in which the component has been fitted or to the directions given by the producer of that product.
 Art. 1386-12
       A producer may not invoke the exonerating circumstance provided for in Article 1386-11, 4°, where damage was
 caused by an element of the human body or by products thereof.
       [repealed]
 Art. 1386-13
       The liability of a producer may be reduced or disallowed where, having regard to all the circumstances, the damage
 is caused both by a defect in the product and by the fault of the injured person or of a person for whom the injured
 person is responsible.
 Art. 1386-14
       The liability of a producer towards an injured person shall not be reduced where the act or omission of a third party
 contributed to the production of the damage.
 Art. 1386-15
       The clauses which tend to exempt from or to limit the liability for defective products are forbidden and shall be
 deemed not written.
       Nevertheless, as to damages caused to property not used by the injured party mainly for his own private use or
 consumption, the clauses stipulated between professionals are valid.
 Art. 1386-16
       Except for fault of the producer, the liability of the latter, based on the provisions of this Title, shall be extinguished
 on the expiry of a period of ten years after the actual product which caused the damage was put into circulation, unless
 the injured person has in the meantime instituted proceedings.
 Art. 1386-17
       An action for the recovery of damages based on the provisions of this Title is time-barred after a period of three
 years from the date on which the plaintiff knew or ought to have known the damage, the defect and the identity of the
 producer.
 Art. 1386-18
       The provisions of this Title may not affect any rights which an injured person may have according to the rules of
 contractual or tort liability or of a special liability system.
       A producer remains liable for the consequences of his fault or for that of the persons for whom he is responsible.

 Articles 1387 to 1581
        TITLE V
        OF ANTE-NUPTIAL AGREEMENTS AND OF MATRIMONIAL REGIMES
                CHAPTER I
                General Provisions
 Art. 1387
 Articles 1387 to 1387-1
       Legislation regulates conjugal association, with respect to property, only in default of special agreements, which the
 spouses may enter into as they deem proper, provided they are not contrary to public morals and to the following
 provisions.
 Art. 1388
       Spouses may derogate neither to the duties and rights which result for them from  marriage, nor to the rules of
 parental authority, statutory administration and guardianship.
 Art. 1389
       Without prejudice to gratuitous transfers which may take place according to the forms and in the cases provided for
 by this Code, spouses may not make any agreement or waiver whose object would be to change the statutory order of
 successions.
 Art. 1390
       They may, however, stipulate that, at the dissolution of the marriage by the death of one of them, the survivor will
 have the power to acquire or, should the occasion arise, to have allotted to him or her certain personal property of the
 first to die, on condition that he or she accounts for it to the succession, according to the value which they have on the
 day when that power is exercised.
 Art. 1391
       An ante-nuptial agreement shall determine the property to which the power granted to the survivor will relate. It may
 fix methods of appraisal and terms of payment, except abatement in favour of beneficiary heirs where there is an indirect
 advantage.
       Taking into account those clauses and failing an agreement between the parties, the value of the property shall be
 fixed by the tribunal de grande instance.
 Art. 1392
       The power granted to the survivor lapses where he did not exercise it, by notice served upon the heirs of the
 predeceased, within a period of one month after the day when the latter gave him notice to come to a decision. That
 notice may not take place before the expiry of the period provided for in the Title Of Successions for making an inventory
 and deliberating.
       Where served within that period, the notice generates a sale on the day when the power is exercised or, where
 appropriate, constitutes a process of partition.
 Art. 1393
       Spouses may declare, in a general way, that they intend to marry under one of the regimes provided for by this
 Code.
       In the absence of special stipulations derogating from the community regime or modifying it, the rules established in
 the first Part of Chapter II shall constitute the ordinary law of France.
 Art. 1394
       All matrimonial agreements shall be drawn up in an instrument before notaire, in the presence and with the
 simultaneous consent of all the persons who are parties thereto or of their agents.
       At the time of the signature of the agreement, the notaire shall deliver to the parties a certificate on unstamped
 paper and without costs, stating his name and place of residence, the names, first names, occupations and residences
 of the future spouses, as well as the date of the ante-nuptial agreement . That certificate shall state that it must be
 lodged with the officer of civil status before the celebration of the marriage.
       Where the record of marriage mentions that an ante-nuptial agreement was not made, the spouses shall be, with
 regard to third parties, deemed married under the regime of general law, unless, in the transactions entered into with
 those third parties, they have declared that they made an ante-nuptial agreement.
       [repealed by Ord. no 2005-428 of 6 May 2005]
 Art. 1395
       An ante-nuptial agreement must be drawn up before the celebration of the marriage and may take effect only on the
 day of that celebration.
 Art. 1396
       Amendments made in ante-nuptial agreements before the celebration of the marriage must be established by an
 instrument drawn up in the same forms. Furthermore, no change or counter-letter is valid without the presence and the
 simultaneous consent of all the persons who were parties to the ante-nuptial agreement, or of their agents.
       Any amendments or counter-letters, even provided with the forms prescribed by the preceding Article, shall be
 without effect with respect to third parties, unless they were drawn up at the end of the original of the ante-nuptial
 agreement; and a notaire may deliver neither an executory nor an office copy of the ante-nuptial agreement without
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 172/268
CIVIL CODE
 transcribing the amendment or counter-letter at the end.
       After the celebration of the marriage, there may be no amendment to the matrimonial regime except by the effect of
 a judgment, either on the application of one of the spouses, in the case of separation of property or of other judicial
 protective measures, or on joint petition of both spouses, in the case of the following Article.
 Art. 1397
       After two years of application of a matrimonial regime, either conventional or statutory, the spouses may agree in
 the interest of the family to amend it or even to change it entirely, by a notarial instrument, which shall be submitted to
 the approval of the court of their domicile.
       All persons who were parties to the modified agreement shall be summoned in the proceedings in approval; but not
 their heirs, if they have died.
       An approved change has effect between the parties from the judgment and, with regard to third parties, three
 months after mention of it has been entered in the margin of both copies of the record of marriage. However, even failing
 that mention, an amendment is effective against third parties where, in the transactions entered into with them, the
 spouses have declared that they have amended their matrimonial regime;
       Mention of the judgment of approval shall be made on the original of the amended ante-nuptial agreement.
       The application and the decision of approval shall be published on the terms and subject to the penalties provided
 for in the Code of Civil Procedure [...].
       Where there has been a fraud on their rights, creditors may resort to a third party application for revocation of the
 judgment of approval in the way provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 1397-1
       (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975).-The provisions of the preceding Article shall not apply to the agreements entered
 into by spouses in the course of divorce proceedings with the view of liquidating their matrimonial regime.
       Articles 1450 and"265-2" (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2004) shall apply to those agreements.
 Art. 1397-2
 (Act no 97-987 of 28 Oct. 1997)
       Where spouses specify the law applicable to their matrimonial regime under the Convention on the law applicable to
 matrimonial regimes, made in The Hague on 14 March 1978, Articles 1397-3 and 1397-4 shall apply.
 Art. 1397-3
 (Act no 97-987 of 28 Oct. 1997)
       Where the specification of the applicable law is made before the marriage, the future spouses shall present to the
 officer of civil status either the instrument through which they have operated that specification, or a certificate delivered
 by the competent person to establish that instrument. A certificate shall state the names and first names of the future
 spouses, the place where they are living, the date of the instrument of specification, as well as the names, qualifications
 and residence of the person who has established it.
       Where the specification of the applicable law is made in the course of a marriage, the spouses shall have the
 measures or public notice relating to the specification of the applicable law made subject to the conditions and forms
 provided for in the new Code of Civil Procedure.
       On the occasion of the specification of the applicable law, before the marriage or in its course, the spouses may
 specify the nature of the matrimonial regime they choose.
       [repealed by Ord. no 2005-428 of 6 May 2005]
 Art. 1397-4
 (Act no 97-987 of 28 Oct. 1997)
       Where the specification of the applicable law is made in the course of a marriage, that specification takes effect
 between the parties from the establishment of the instrument of specification and, with respect to third parties, three
 months after the formalities of public notice provided for in Article 1397-3 have been fulfilled.
       However, even failing fulfilment of those formalities, the specification of the applicable law is effective against third
 parties where, in the transactions entered into with them, the spouses have declared which law  is applicable to their
 matrimonial regime.
 Art. 1397-5
 (Act no 97-987 of 28 Oct. 1997)
       Where a change in the matrimonial regime takes place in accordance with a foreign law which governs the effects
 of the marriage, the spouses shall have public notice made as provided for in the new Code of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 1397-6
 (Act no 97-987 of 28 Oct. 1997)
       A change of matrimonial regime takes effect between the parties from the  judgment or from the instrument which
 provides for it and, with respect to third parties, three months after the formalities of notice provided for in Article 1397-5
 have been fulfilled.
       However, even failing fulfilment of those formalities, the change of matrimonial regime is effective against third
 parties where, in the transactions entered into with them, the spouses have declared that they have amended their
 matrimonial regime.
 Art. 1398
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 173/268
CIVIL CODE
       A minor having capacity to contract marriage has capacity to consent to all the agreements of which that contract is
 susceptible and the agreements and gifts he has made therein are valid, provided he had, in making the agreement, the
 assistance of all the persons whose consent is necessary for the validity of the marriage.
       Where matrimonial conventions have been entered into without that assistance, the annulment thereof may be sued
 for by the minor or by the persons whose consent was required, but only up to the expiry of the year following the
 coming of age.
 Art. 1399
       An adult in guardianship or curatorship may not enter into matrimonial conventions unless assisted, at the contract,
 by those who must consent to his marriage.
       Failing that assistance, annulment of the agreements may be sought within the year of the marriage, either by the
 person under a disability himself, or by those whose consent was required, or by the guardian or the curator.
 Article 1387-1
 (Act no 2005-882 of 2 Aug. 2005)
       Where divorce is granted, if liabilities or securities have been created by the spouses, jointly and severally or
 separately, in the context of the management of a concern, the tribunal de grande instance  may rule that the exclusive
 burden thereof shall be borne by the spouse who retains the professional assets or, failing which, the professional
 qualifications which served as a basis for the concern.
                CHAPTER II
                Of the Regime of Community of Property
                        Part I
                        Of the Statutory Community of Property
 Art. 1400
 Articles 1401 to 1528 to
 1535
 Articles 1401 to 1400
       Community of property which is established failing an agreement or by a simple declaration of being married under
 the community of property regime, is subject to the rules explained in the following three Sections.
                                SECTION I
                                Of What a Community is Composed as to Assets and Liabilities
                                        Paragraph 1
                                        Of the Assets of the Community
 Art. 1401
 Articles 1401 to 1419
 and 1420.
 Articles 1401 to 1408
       The assets of the community comprise acquisitions made by the spouses together or separately during the
 marriage, and coming both from their personal activity and from savings made on the fruits and incomes of their
 personal property.
 Art. 1402
       Any property, movable or immovable, shall be deemed an acquisition of the community where it is not proved that it
 is a separate property of one of the spouses in accordance with a provision of law.
       Where a property is one of those which do not display proof or mark of their origin, personal ownership of a spouse,
 if disputed, shall be established in writing. Failing an inventory or other contemporaneously constituted proof, the judge
 may take into consideration all writings, in particular family instruments of title, registers and papers, as well as bank
 documents and invoices. He may even admit testimonial or presumptive evidence, where he observes that it was
 materially or morally impossible for one spouse to obtain a writing.
 Art. 1403
       Each spouse retains full ownership of his or her separate property.
       The community is entitled only to fruits collected and not consumed. But a reimbursement may be due to it, at the
 time of the dissolution of the community, for fruits which a spouse failed to collect or has fraudulently consumed, without,
 however, any inquiry being admissible further than the last five years.
 Art. 1404
       Constitute separate property by their nature, even where they have been acquired during the marriage, clothes and
 belongings for the personal use of one of the spouses, actions for compensation for bodily or moral harm, inalienable
 claims and pensions, and, more generally, all property which has a personal character and all rights exclusively attached
 to the person.
       Constitute also separate property by their nature, but subject to a reimbursement if there is occasion, implements
 necessary to the occupation of one of the spouses, unless they are accessory to business assets or to an enterprise
 forming part of the community.
 Art. 1405
       Remain separate property the items of property of which the spouses had ownership or possession on the day of
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 174/268
CIVIL CODE
 the celebration of the marriage, or which they acquire, during the marriage, through succession, gift or legacy.
       A gratuitous transfer may stipulate that the property which is its subject-matter will belong to the community.
 Property falls into community, unless otherwise stipulated, where a gratuitous transfer is made jointly to both spouses.
       Property surrendered or transferred by the father, mother or other ascendant to one of the spouses, either in order
 to discharge what he owes to him or her, or under the obligation of paying debts of the donor to outsiders, remain
 separate property, subject to reimbursement.
 Art. 1406
       Constitute separate property, subject to reimbursement if there is occasion, property acquired as accessory to a
 separate property as well as new securities and other increases connected with securities which are separate property.
       Constitute also separate property, through the effect of real subrogation, claims and indemnities which take the
 place of separate property, as well as property acquired in investment or reinvestment, in accordance with Articles 1434
 and 1435.
 Art. 1407
       Property acquired in exchange for a property which belonged separately to one of the spouses is itself separate
 property, subject to reimbursement due to the community or by it, where there is a balance.
       However, where the balance charged to the community is greater than the value of the transferred property, the
 property acquired in exchange falls into the common stock, subject to reimbursement for the benefit of the transferor.
 Art. 1408
       An acquisition, made by auction or otherwise, of a part of a property of which one of the spouses was an undivided
 owner, does not constitute an acquisition, subject to the reimbursement due to the community for the sum it may have
 supplied.
                                        Paragraph 2
                                        Of the Liabilities of the Community
 Art. 1409
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       The liabilities of the community comprise:
 Articles 1409 to 1419
 and 1420.
       - definitively, maintenance due by the spouses and debts incurred by them for the support of the household and the
 education of children, under Article 220;
       - definitively or subject to reimbursement, according to the circumstances, other debts arising during the community.
 Art. 1410
       Debts which the spouses owed on the day of the celebration of the marriage, or with which the successions and
 gratuitous transfers falling to them during the marriage are burdened, remain personal to them, both as to capital and to
 arrears or interest.
 Art. 1411
       In the case of the preceding Article, creditors of either spouse may only enforce payment on the separate property
 “and the income” (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) of their debtor.
       They may also, however, seize property of the community where the movables which belonged to their debtor on
 the day of the marriage or which fell to him by succession or gratuitous transfer have been merged into the common
 patrimony and can no longer be identified under the rules of Article 1402.
 Art. 1412
       Reimbursement is due to the community which has paid a personal debt of a spouse.
 Art. 1413
       (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985).-Payment of debts which either spouse owes, for whatever reason, during the
 community, may always be enforced on community property, unless there was fraud of the debtor spouse and bad faith
 of the creditor, and subject to reimbursement due to the community, if there is occasion.
 Art. 1414
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       The earnings and wages of a spouse may be attached by the creditors of his or her spouse only where the
 obligation was contracted for the support of the household or the education of children, under Article 220.
       Where the earnings and wages are paid into a current or deposit account, the latter may be attached only under the
 conditions determined by decree.
 Art. 1415
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Each spouse may obligate only his separate property and his income, by surety or loan, unless they have been
 contracted with the express consent of the other spouse, who, in that case, does not obligate his separate property.
 Art. 1416
       A community which has discharged a debt for which it may have been sued under the preceding Articles, is
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 175/268
CIVIL CODE
 nevertheless entitled to reimbursement, whenever that undertaking had been contracted in the personal interest of one
 of the spouses, for example for the acquisition, preservation or improvement of a separate property.
 Art. 1417
       A community is entitled to reimbursement, deduction being made, if there is occasion, of the benefit derived for it,
 where it paid fines incurred by one spouse by reasons of criminal offences, or damages and costs for which he or she
 had been held liable in tort.
       It is likewise entitled to reimbursement where the debt which it discharged was contracted by one of the spouses in
 contempt of the duties which the marriage  prescribed to him or her.
 Art. 1418
       Where a debt has become a community debt in only one spouse’s right, it may not be enforced on the separate
 property of the other.
       Where it is joint and several, a debt is deemed to become a community debt in both spouses’ right. [repealed]

 Art. 1421
                                SECTION II
                                Of Administration of the Community and of the Separate Property
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
 Articles 1421 to 1440
       Each spouse has the power to administer alone the common property and to dispose of it, subject to being
 accountable for faults committed in his or her management. Transactions entered into without fraud by a spouse are
 enforceable against the other.
       A spouse who follows a separate profession, has alone the power to perform acts of administration and disposition
 necessary for it.
       All of which is subject to Articles 1422 to 1425.
 Art. 1422
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       One spouse may not, without the other, dispose inter vivos, gratuitously, of the common property.
       (Ord. no 2006-346 of 23 March 2206) Nor may he, without the other, assign a common property to the guarantee of
 a third person's debt.
 Art. 1423
       (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985).-A legacy made by one spouse may not exceed his or her share in the
 community.
       Where a spouse has bequeathed a property of the community, the legatee may claim it in kind only if, by the effect
 of partition, the property falls into the share of the testator’s heirs; if the property does not fall into the share of those
 heirs, the legatee is entitled to reimbursement of the total value of the property bequeathed, on the share, in the
 community, of the heirs of the testator spouse and on the separate property of the latter.
 Art. 1424
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       One spouse may not, without the other, transfer or encumber with rights in rem immovables, business assets and
 enterprises depending on the community, or non-negotiable rights in a firm and tangible movables whose alienation
 requires public notice. One spouse may not, without the other, collect the capital coming from those operations.
 Art. 1425
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       One spouse may not, without the other, give on lease a rural tenement or an immovable for commercial, industrial
 or craft use depending on the community. Other leases on common property may be entered into by one spouse alone
 and are subject to the rules provided for regarding  leases made by a usufructuary.
 Art. 1426
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Where one of the spouses is, in an enduring way, unable to express his or her wish, or if his or her management of
 the community reveals unfitness or fraud, the other spouse may request in court to be substituted for him or her in the
 exercise of those powers. The provisions of Articles 1445 to 1447 shall apply to that request.
       A spouse thus entitled by court has the same powers which the spouse whom he or she replaces would have had;
 he or she may, with the authorization of the court, enter into transactions for which his or her consent would have been
 required if a substitution had not taken place.
       A spouse deprived of his or her powers may, later on, request their restitution to the court, by establishing that their
 transfer to the other spouse is no longer justified.
 Art. 1427
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)

 annulment of it, unless he has ratified the transaction.
       An action for annulment may be brought by the spouse during two years after the day when he had knowledge of
 the transaction, without never being admissible more that two years after the dissolution of the community.
 Art. 1428
       Each spouse has the administration and enjoyment of his or her separate property and may dispose of it freely.
       Art.1429.
       -Where one of the spouses is, in an enduring way, unable to express his or her wish, or if he or she imperils the
 interests of the family, either by allowing his or her separate property to waste away or by dissipating or embezzling the
 income withdrawn from them, he or she may, on application of the other spouse, be divested of the rights of
 administration and enjoyment attributed by the preceding Article. The provisions of Article 1445 to 1447 shall apply to
 that application.
       Unless the appointment of a judicial administrator appears necessary, the judgment shall grant to the plaintiff
 spouse the power to administer the separate property of the divested spouse, as well as to collect the fruits thereof,
 which shall be appropriated to the marriage expenses and the excess used for the benefit of the community.
       From the application, the deprived spouse may dispose alone of the bare ownership of his or her property only.
       He or she may, later on, request the restitution of his or her rights to the court, if he or she establishes that the
 causes which had justified the divesting no longer exist.

 Art. 1431
       Where, during the marriage, one of the spouses grants to the other the administration of his or her separate
 property, the rules of agency shall apply. The agent spouse is, however, dispensed from accounting for fruits, where the
 power of attorney does not expressly so require.
 Art. 1432
       Where one of the spouses takes in hand the management of the separate property of the other, with the knowledge
 of the latter but nevertheless without opposition on his or her part, there is deemed to be an implied agency, with
 authority to make acts of administration and enjoyment, but not acts of disposition.
       That spouse shall be responsible for his or her management towards the other as would an agent. However, he or
 she must account only for existing fruits; as regards those which he or she failed to collect or fraudulently consumed, he
 or she may be sued only within a limitation of the last five years.
       Where one of the spouses has interfered in the management of the separate property of the other in contempt of an
 established opposition, he or she is liable for all the results of his or her interference and accountable without limitation
 for all the fruits which he or she has collected, failed to collect or fraudulently consumed.
 Art. 1433
       The community owes reimbursement to the owner spouse whenever it has drawn benefit from separate property.
       It shall be so, notably, where it has collected funds which were separate property or which came from the sale of a
 separate property, without there having been made investment or re-investment.
       Where a controversy arises, proof that community drew benefit from separate property may be adduced by any
 means, including testimony and presumptions.
 Art. 1434
       Investment or re-investment is deemed made with regard to a spouse, whenever, at the time of an acquisition, it is
 declared that it was made from separate funds, or from funds coming from the disposal of a separate property, and in
 order to take its place as investment or re-investment. Failing such declaration in the instrument, investment or
 re-investment takes place only through agreement of the spouses and produces effect only in their reciprocal
 relationships.

 Art. 1435
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Where investment or re-investment is made in anticipation, the property acquired is separate, provided that the
 sums expected from the separate patrimony be paid to the community within five years after the date of the transaction.
 Art. 1436
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Where the price and expenses of the acquisition exceed the sum from which investment or re-investment was
 made, the community is entitled to reimbursement for the excess. Where, however, the share of the community is
 greater than that of the acquiring spouse, the property acquired falls into community, subject to reimbursement due to
 the spouse.
 Art. 1437
       Whenever a sum is taken from the community, either to discharge the personal debts or charges of one of the
 spouses, such as the price or part of the price of a separate property of his or her own, or the redemption of land
 services, or for the recovery, preservation or improvement of his or her personal property, and generally whenever one

 Art. 1438
       Where the father and mother jointly make a gift in favour of a common child without specifying the portion for which
 they intended to contribute thereto, they are deemed to have contributed each for one half, whether the gift was
 provided or promised from community property, or whether from personal property of one of the spouses.
       In the second case, the spouse from whose personal property the gift was made has, on the property of the other,
 an action for compensation for half of the said gift, having regard to the value of the property donated at the time of the
 gift.
 Art. 1439
       A gift made to a common child from community property is charged to the community.
       (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) It is borne by each spouse for one half on the dissolution of the community,
 unless one of them, in making it, expressly declared that he or she would take charge of it for the whole or for a share
 exceeding one half.
 Art. 1440
       Warranty of the gift is due from any person who made it; and interest runs as from the day of the marriage,

 Art. 1441
       A community is dissolved:
       1° By the death of one of the spouses;

 Art. 1443
       Where through the disorder of the affairs, misadministration or misconduct of one spouse, it appears that the
 upholding of the community imperils the interest of the other spouse, the latter may sue  in court for separation of
 property.
       Any voluntary separation is void.
 Art. 1444
       Separation of property, although ordered in court, is void where the proceedings tending to liquidate the rights of the
 parties have not be initiated within three months after the judgment has become res judicata  or where the final
 settlement has not occurred within the year of the opening of the process of liquidation. The period of one year may be
 extended by the president of the court in the form of interim relief proceedings.
 Art. 1445
       The application and judgment of separation of property shall be given public notice on the terms and subject to the
 penalties provided for by the Code of Civil Procedure [...].
       A judgment ordering a separation of property extends back as to its effect to the day of the application.
       Mention of the judgment shall be made in the margin of the record of marriage  as well as on the original of the
 ante-nuptial agreement.

 Art. 1448
       The spouse who has obtained the separation of property shall contribute, in proportion to his or her means and to

       He or she shall bear entirely those expenses, where nothing is left to the other.
 Art. 1449
       A separation of property judicially ordered has the effect of putting the spouses under the regime of Articles 1536

       (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) The court, where it pronounces separation, may order that one of the spouses
 shall pay his or her contribution into the hands of the other spouse, who shall assume alone thenceforth with regard to
 third parties the payment of all the liabilities of the marriage.

                                        Of Liquidation and Partition of the Community
 Articles 1467 to 1481
       After the dissolution of the community, each spouse shall retake that of his or her property which did not fall into the
 community, where it exists in kind, or the property subrogated thereto.
       Then shall take place the liquidation of the common stock, as to assets and liabilities.
 Art. 1468
       Shall be established in the name of each spouse an account of the reimbursement which the community owes to
 him or her and of the reimbursement which he or she owes to the community, in accordance with the rules prescribed in
 the preceding Sections.
 Art. 1469
       Reimbursement shall be, in general, equal to the smaller of the two sums which the expenditures made and the
 profit still extant represent.
       However, it may not be less than the expenditure made where the latter was necessary.
       (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) It may not be less than the profit still extant where the value borrowed was used
 to acquire, preserve or improve a property which is found, on the day of the liquidation of the community, in the borrower
 patrimony. Where the property acquired, preserved or improved has been alienated before the liquidation, the profit shall
 be appraised on the day of the alienation; where a new property has been subrogated to the alienated property, the
 profit shall be appraised with regard to that new property.
 Art. 1470
       Where, after the balance is made, the account presents a residue in favour of the community, the spouse shall
 return the amount thereof to the common stock.
       Where it presents a residue in favour of a spouse, the latter has the option either to require payment or to
 appropriate common property up to the amount due.
 Art. 1471
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Appropriations shall be enforced first on ready money, next on the movables and subsidiarily on the immovables of
 the community. A spouse who makes the appropriation is entitled to choose the movables and immovables which he or
 she appropriates. He or she  may not, however, prejudice by that option the rights which the other spouse may have to
 request the continuation of the undivided property or the preferential allotment of certain items of property.
       Where the spouses wish to appropriate the same property, one shall proceed by drawing lots.
 Art. 1472
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       In case the community is not adequate, the appropriations of each spouse shall be in proportion to the amount of
 the reimbursement which are due to him or her.
       However, where the inadequacy of the community is imputable to the fault of one of the spouses, the other spouse
 may make appropriation before him or her on the whole of common property; he or she may make them subsidiarily on

 Art. 1473
       Reimbursement due by the community or to the community bears interest by operation of law from the day of the
 dissolution.
       (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) However, where a reimbursement is equal to the profit still extant, interest runs
 from the day of liquidation.
 Art. 1474
       Appropriations in common property constitute an operation of partition. They do not confer on the spouse who
 enforces them any right to be preferred to the creditors of the community, except the priority resulting from legal
 mortgage, where there is occasion.
 Art. 1475
       After all appropriations have been carried out on the stock, the excess shall be divided by halves between the
 spouses.
       Where an immovable of the community is an annex of another immovable belonging separately to one of the
 spouses, or where it is contiguous to that building, the owner spouse has the power to have it allotted to him or her by
 deduction from his or her share or subject to a balance, according to the value of the property on the day when allotment
 is requested.
 Art. 1476
       Partition of a community, as to everything relating to its forms, continuation of undivided ownership and preferential
 allotment, auction of property, effects of partition, warranty and balances is subject to all the rules established in the Title
 Of Successions with respect to partitions between coheirs.
       However, as to communities dissolved by divorce, judicial separation or separation of property, preferential
 allotment is never as of right, and it may always be ordered that the whole of a balance which may be due shall be
 payable cash.
 Art. 1477
       (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2002) Likewise, the spouse who has knowingly concealed the existence of a common
 debt shall take charge of it definitively.
 Art. 1478
       After a partition is closed, where one of the spouses is the personal creditor of the other, for instance because the
 proceeds of his or her property have been used to pay a personal debt of the other spouse, or for any other cause, he or
 she may enforce the claim against the share of the community coming to the other or against the other’s separate
 property.
 Art. 1479
       The personal claims which the spouses have to enforce against each other do not give rise to appropriation and
 bear interest only from the day of the demand.
       (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, they shall be appraised according to the
 rules of Article 1469, paragraph 3, in the cases for which it provides; interest then runs from the day of the liquidation.
 Art. 1480
       Gifts which one of the spouses may have made to the other shall be enforced only on the share of the donor in the
 community and on his or her separate property.

       Each spouse may be sued for the whole of the debts existing on the day of dissolution, which had entered into the
 community in his or her own right.
 Art. 1483
       Each spouse may be sued only for half of the debts which had entered into the community in the other spouse’s
 right.
       (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) After partition, and save the case of concealment, he or she is liable for them only
 up to the share of the assets which he or she receives, provided there was an inventory, and under the obligation to
 account both for the contents of that inventory and for what he or she has received through the partition, as well as for
 the common liabilities already discharged.
 Art. 1484

 months after the day when the community was dissolved, except for extension of time granted by an interim relief judge.
 It shall be asserted genuine and true before the public officer who received it.
 Art. 1485
       Each spouse shall contribute by halves to the community debts for which a reimbursement was not due, as well as
 to the costs of sealing, inventory, sale of movables, liquidation, auction and partition.
       He or she bears alone the debts which had become common only subject to reimbursement chargeable to him or
 her.
 Art. 1486
       The spouse who may take advantage of the benefit of Article 1483, paragraph 2, does not contribute for more than
 the share of the assets which he or she receives to the debts which had entered into the community in the other
 spouse’s right, unless it is a question of debts for which he or she owed reimbursement.
 Art. 1487
       The spouse who paid above the portion for which he or she was liable under the preceding Articles has a remedy
 for the excess against the other.
 Art. 1488
       He or she has not, for that excess, any recovery against the creditor, unless the receipt states that he or she intends
 to pay only within the limit of his or her obligation.
 Art. 1489
       The spouse who, by the effect of a mortgage enforced on an immovable which he received in partition, is sued for
 the whole of a community debt has as of right a remedy against the other for half of that debt.
 Art. 1490
       The provisions of the preceding Articles are not a bar to a clause of the partition which, without prejudicing the rights
 of third parties, obliges either spouse to pay a portion of the debts other than that which is fixed above, or even to
 discharge the liabilities in full.

       2° That it will be derogated to the rules relating to administration;
       3° That one of the spouse will have the power to appropriate certain property on condition of an indemnity;
       4° That one of the spouses will have an appropriation clause;
       5° That the spouses will have unequal shares;
       6° That there will be a universal community between them.
       The rules on statutory community shall remain applicable on all questions which have not been the subject of the
 agreement of the parties.

 Art. 1498
 Articles 1498 to 1502
       Where spouses agree that there will be between them a community of movables and acquisitions, the common
 assets comprise, in addition to property which would form part of it under the regime of statutory community, the
 movable property of which the spouses had ownership or possession on the day of the marriage or which has fallen to
 them afterwards through succession or gratuitous transfer, unless the donor or testator has stipulated the contrary.
       Remains separate property, nevertheless, that of the movable property which would have formed separate property
 by its nature by virtue of Article 1404, under the statutory regime, if it had been acquired during the community.
       Where one of the spouses acquires an immovable after the ante-nuptial agreement, which contained  a stipulation
 of community of movables and acquisitions, and before the celebration of the marriage, the immovable acquired during
 that interval enters the community, unless  the acquisition was made in performance of some clause of the ante-nuptial
 agreement, in which case it is regulated according to the agreement.
 Art. 1499

       Form part of the liabilities of the community, under that regime, other than the debts which would form part of it
 under the statutory regime, a fraction of those with which the spouses were already burdened when  they married, or
 with which successions and gratuitous transfer which fall to them during the marriage are burdened.
       The fraction of liabilities which the community bears is proportionate to the fraction of assets which it receives,
 according to the rules of the preceding Article, either from the patrimony of the spouse on the day of the marriage, or
 from the whole of property which is the subject of the succession or gratuitous transfer.
       In order to establish that proportion, the consistency and value of the assets shall be proved in accordance with
 Article 1402.
 Art. 1500
       The debts to which the community is liable, as a counterpart of the property it receives, are its final responsibility.
 Art. 1501
       The apportionment of liabilities prior to the marriage or burdening successions and gratuitous transfers may not
 prejudice the creditors. They keep, in all cases, the right to seize property which previously constituted their security.
 They may even enforce their payment against the whole of the community, where the movable property of their debtor
 has been merged into the common patrimony and may no longer be identified under the rules of Article 1402.

       Spouses may stipulate that the survivor or one of them if he or she survives, or even one of them in all the cases of
 dissolution of the community, will have the power to appropriate certain common property, with the responsibility of
 accounting for it to the community according to the value it has on the day of partition, unless otherwise agreed.
 Art. 1512
       An ante-nuptial agreement may fix the bases of appraisal and the terms of payment of a possible balance. Having
 regard to those clauses and failing an agreement between the parties, the value of that property shall be fixed by the
 tribunal de grande instance.
 Art. 1513
       A power of appropriation lapses where the benefiting spouse does not exercise it by notice served upon the other
 spouse or his or her heirs within a period of one month after the day when the latter have served upon him or her notice
 to come to a decision. That notice may not itself be served before the expiry of the period provided for in the Title Of
 Successions for making an inventory and deliberating.
 Art. 1514
       Appropriation is an operation of partition: property appropriated is deduced from the share of the benefiting spouse;
 where its value exceeds that share, there is occasion for payment of a balance.
       Spouses may agree that the indemnity owed by the maker of an appropriation will be deduced subsidiarily from his
 or her rights in the succession of the predeceased spouse.

 survives, will be authorized to appropriate from the common stock, before any partition, either a specified sum, or a
 specified property in kind, or a specified quantity of a determined kind of property.
 Art. 1516
       Appropriation is not considered as a gift, either as to substance, or as to form, but as a agreement relating to
 marriage  and between partners.

 Article 265" (Act no 2004-439 of 26 May 2002). He or she may require surety from the other spouse in warranty of those
 rights.
 Art. 1519
       Creditors of the community are always entitled to have the articles appropriated sold, subject to the remedy of the
 spouse against the remainder of the community.
                                SECTION V
                                Of the Stipulation of Unequal Shares
 Art. 1520
       Spouses may derogate from the partition established by law.
 Art. 1521
 Articles 1520 to 1525
       Where it has been stipulated that a spouse and his or her heirs will have only a certain share in the community,
 such as a third or a fourth, the spouse thus limited or his or her heirs are liable for the debts of the community only in
 proportion to the share which they take from the assets.
       The agreement is void where it compels the spouse thus limited or his or her heirs to bear a larger part, or where it
 exempts them from bearing a share of the debts equal to that which they take from the assets.
 Art. 1522 and 1523
       [repealed]
 Art. 1524
       Allotment of the entire community may be agreed only for the case of survival, either for the benefit of a specified
 spouse, or for the benefit of whoever survives. The spouse who thus retains the whole of the community is obliged to
 pay all its debts.
       It may also be agreed, for the case of survival, that one of the spouses will have, in addition to his or her half, the
 usufruct of the predeceased’s share. In that case, he or she shall contribute to the debts, as to the usufruct, according to
 the rules of Article 612.
       The provisions of Article 1518 shall apply to those clauses when the community is dissolved in the lifetime of the
 two spouses.
 Art. 1525
       A stipulation of unequal shares and a clause of full allotment are not deemed a gift, neither as to substance nor as
 to form, but simply agreements relating to marriage  and between partners.
       Unless otherwise stipulated, they may not prevent the heirs of the predeceased spouse to take back the
 contributions and capital having fallen into the community in the right of  their predecessor in title.
                                SECTION VI
                                Of Universal Community
 Art. 1526
 Article 1526
       Spouses may by their ante-nuptial agreement establish a universal community of their property, movable and
 immovable, present and future. However, unless otherwise stipulated, property which Article 1404 declares separate by
 its nature does no fall into that community.
       A universal community bears definitively all the debts of the spouses, present and future.
                        Provisions Common
                        to the Two Parts of Chapter II
 Art. 1527
 Articles 1527 to 1528 to
 1535
       The advantages which either spouse may draw from the clauses of a conventional community, as well as those
 which may result from a mingling of movables or of debts, are not deemed gifts.
       (Act no 2001-1135 of 3 Dec. 2001) However, in the case where there are children who are not born of the two
 spouses, any agreement having the consequence of donating to one of the spouses beyond the portion regulated by
 Article 1094-1, in the Title Of Gifts Inter Vivos and of Wills is ineffective as to the whole excess; but mere gains resulting
 from common business and from savings made out of the respective although unequal incomes of both spouses are not
 considered as an advantage made to the prejudice of the children of another bed.

                CHAPTER III
                Of the Regime of Separate Property
 Art. 1536
 Articles 1536 to 1544 to
 1568
       Where spouses have stipulated in their ante-nuptial agreement that their property will be separate, each of them
 keeps the administration, enjoyment and free disposal of his or her personal property.
       Each remains alone liable for the debts arising in his or her self, before or during marriage,  except in the case of
 Article 220.
 Art. 1537
       The spouses shall contribute to the expenses of the marriage in accordance with the terms of their agreement; and
 where none exists in this regard, in the proportion determined by Article 214.
 Art. 1538
       With respect both to the other spouse and to third parties, a spouse may prove by any means that he or she has the
 exclusive ownership of a property.
       The presumptions of ownership established in the ante-nuptial agreement are effective with respect to third parties,
 as well as in the relations between spouses, unless otherwise agreed. Counter proof is as of right, and may be made by
 any means appropriate to establish that the property does not belong to the spouse designated by the presumption, or
 even, where it belongs to him or her, that it was acquired through a gratuitous transfer from the other spouse.
       Property on which neither spouse may establish an exclusive ownership is deemed to belong to them in undivided
 ownership, to each by half.
 Art. 1539
       Where, during the marriage, one of the spouses entrusts to the other the administration of his personal property, the
 rules of agency shall apply. The agent spouse is however exempted from accounting for the fruits, if the power of
 attorney does not expressly oblige him or her to do so.
 Art. 1540
       Where one of the spouses takes the management of the other’s business in hand, with the knowledge of the latter
 and nevertheless without opposition on his or her part, she or he is deemed to have an implied agency, with authority to
 make acts of administration and enjoyment, but not acts of disposition.
       That spouse is responsible for his or her management to the other as an agent. However, he or she is accountable
 only for the existing fruits; as regards those which he has failed to collect or fraudulently consumed, he may be sued
 only within the limit of the last five years.
       Where one of the spouses has interfered in the management of the other’s property in contempt of an established
 opposition, he or she is responsible for all the consequences of that interference, and accountable without limitation for
 all the fruits which he or she has collected, failed to collect or fraudulently consumed.
 Art. 1541
       One of the spouses is not the warrantor of a failure to invest or reinvest the other’s property, unless he or she has
 interfered in operations of alienation or collection or unless it is proved that the funds were received by him or her, or he
 or she has profited by them.
 Art. 1542
 (Act no 75-617 of 11 July 1975)
       After dissolution of a marriage by the death of one of the spouses, the partition of the undivided property between
 spouses with separate property, as to all that relates to its forms, maintenance of undivided ownership and preferential
 allotment, auction of property, effects of partition, warranty and balances, is subject to all the rules which are established
 in the Title Of Successions for partitions between co-heirs.
       The same rules shall apply after divorce or judicial separation. However, preferential allotment shall never be as of
 right. It may always be decided that the whole of a balance which may be owed shall be payable cash.
 Art. 1543
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       The rules of Article 1479 shall apply to the claims which one spouse may have to enforce against the other.
 Art. 1544 to 1568
       [repealed]
                CHAPTER IV
                Of the Regime of Separation in Acquisitions
 Art. 1569
 Articles 1569 to 1581
       Where the spouses have declared that they married under the regime of participation in acquisitions, each of them
 keeps the administration, enjoyment and free disposal of his or her personal property, without distinguishing between
 that which belonged to him or her on the day of the marriage or which has come to him or her after by succession or
 gratuitous transfer and that which he or she has acquired for value during the marriage. During the marriage, that regime
 operates as if the spouses were married under the regime of separation of property. At the dissolution of the regime,
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 184/268
CIVIL CODE
 each spouse is entitled to participate by halves in value in the net acquisitions found in the patrimony of the other, and
 estimated owing to the double appraisal of the original patrimony and of the final patrimony.
       The right to participate in the acquisitions may not be assigned as long as the matrimonial regime is not dissolved.
 Where dissolution occurs through the death of one spouse, his or her heirs have, on the net acquisitions made by the
 other, the same rights as their predecessor in title.
 Art. 1570
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       An original patrimony includes the property which belonged to the spouse on the day of the marriage and those
 which he or she has acquired afterwards by succession or gratuitous transfer, as well as all property which, in the
 regime of community, constitutes separate property by its nature without giving rise to reimbursement. Account shall not
 be taken of the fruits of that property nor of the parts of that property which would have been in the nature of fruit or of
 which the spouse has disposed through gift inter vivos during the marriage.
       The composition of the original patrimony shall be proved by a descriptive statement, even under private signature,
 established in the presence of the other spouse and signed by him or her.
       Failing a descriptive statement, or where it is incomplete, proof of the composition of the original patrimony may be
 adduced only through the means of Article 1402.
 Art. 1571
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Original property shall be appraised according to its condition on the day of the marriage or of the acquisition and
 according to its value on the day when the matrimonial regime is liquidated. Where it has been alienated, one shall
 retain its value on the day of the alienation. Where new property has been subrogated to property alienated, one shall
 take into consideration the value of that new property.
       From the original assets shall be deducted the debts with which they were burdened, re-evaluated, if there is
 occasion, according to the rules of Article 1469, paragraph 3. Where the liabilities exceed the assets, that excess shall
 be fictitiously united to the final patrimony.
 Art. 1572
       Form part of the final patrimony all the property which belongs to a spouse on the day when the matrimonial regime 
is dissolved, including, where appropriate, that of which he or she may have disposed of mortis causa and without
 excluding the sums of which he or she may be creditor against the other spouse. Where there is a divorce, judicial
 separation or anticipated liquidation of the acquisitions, the matrimonial regime is deemed dissolved on the day of the
 application.
       The composition of the final patrimony shall be proved by a descriptive statement, even under private signature,
 which a spouse or his or her heirs must establish in the presence of the other spouse or of his or her heirs, or they
 having been duly summoned. That statement shall be drawn up within nine months after the dissolution of the
 matrimonial regime, except for extension of time granted by the president of the court in the form of interim relief
 proceedings.
       Proof that the final patrimony would have included other property may be adduced by any means, even by
 testimony and presumptions.
       Each spouse may, as to the property of the other, require the fixing of seals and an inventory in accordance with the
 rules provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 1573
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       To the existing property shall be fictitiously joined the property which is not included in the original patrimony and of
 which a spouse has disposed by gift inter vivos without the consent of the other spouse, as well as that which he or she
 has fraudulently alienated. An alienation on
       condition of a life annuity or non-repayable shall be presumed to have been made in fraud of the spouse’s rights,
 unless the latter agreed.
 Art. 1574
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Existing property shall be appraised according to its condition at the time of the dissolution of the matrimonial
 regime and to its value on the day of the liquidation of the latter. Property alienated by gifts inter vivos, or in fraud of the
 rights of the other spouse shall be appraised according to its condition on the day of the alienation and to the value
 which it would have had, if it had been kept, on the day of the liquidation.
       From the assets thus replenished shall be deducted all the debts which are not yet discharged, including the sums
 which may be owed to the other spouse.
       The value, on the day of alienation, of the improvements brought about during the marriage in an original  property
 donated by one spouse without the consent of the other before the dissolution of the matrimonial regime shall be added
 to the final patrimony.
 Art. 1575
       Where the final patrimony of a spouse is less than his or her original patrimony, the deficit is borne entirely by that
 spouse. Where it is greater, the increase constitutes the net acquisitions and gives rise to participation.
       Where there are net acquisitions on both sides, they shall first be set off. Only the excess shall be partitioned: the
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 185/268
CIVIL CODE
 spouse whose gain is the lesser is creditor with regard to the other spouse for half of that excess.
       To a claim for participation, one shall add, in order to put them under the same settlement, the sums of which a
 spouse may in other respects be creditor towards the other, for values provided during the marriage  and other
 indemnities, deduction being made, where necessary, of what that spouse may be debtor towards the other.
 Art. 1576
       A claim for participation gives rise to payment in money. Where a debtor spouse meets serious difficulties in making
 it entirely as soon as the liquidation is closed, the judges may grant him or her a time which may not exceed five years,
 subject to the condition of giving security and paying interest.
       A claim for participation may however give rise to a settlement in kind, either by consent of both spouses, or under
 an order of the judge where the debtor spouse proves serious difficulties which prevent him or her from discharging it in
 money.
       The settlement in kind provided for in the preceding paragraph is considered as an operation of partition where the
 property allotted was not included in the original patrimony or where the allottee spouse shares in the succession of the
 other.
       The liquidation is not effective against creditors of the spouses: they retain the right to seize property allotted to the
 spouse of their debtor.
 Art. 1577
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       A creditor spouse shall enforce payment of his or her claim for participation first on existing property and
 subsidiarily, beginning with the most recent alienations, on the property mentioned in Article 1573 which had been
 alienated by gifts inter vivos or in fraud of the rights of the other spouse.
 Art. 1578
       Upon dissolution of the matrimonial regime, where the parties do not agree to proceed to liquidation through
 agreement, one of them may apply to the court for having it proceeded to in court.
       The rules prescribed for reaching a judicial partition of successions and communities shall apply to that application,
 as may be thought proper.
       The parties shall communicate reciprocally to each other and shall communicate to the experts designated by the
 judge, all information and documents appropriate to the liquidation.
       A claim for liquidation is time-barred after three years from the dissolution of the matrimonial regime. Claims lying
 against third parties “under Article 1167” (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) are time- barred after two years from the
 close of the liquidation.
 Art. 1579
       Where application of the rules of appraisal provided for by Articles 1571 and 1574 above would lead to a result
 obviously contrary to equity, the court may derogate from them on the application of one of the spouses.
 Art. 1580
       Where the disorder of the affairs, misadministration or misconduct of one spouse, give rise to fearing that the
 continuance of the matrimonial regime  imperils the interest of the other, the latter may apply for the anticipated
 liquidation of his or her claim for participation.
       The rules of separation of property shall apply to that application.
       Where the application is entertained, the spouses shall be placed under the system of articles 1536 to 1541.
 Art. 1581
       When stipulating participation in acquisitions, the spouses may adopt any term not contrary to Articles 1387, 1388
 and 1389.
       They may in particular agree on a clause of unequal partition, or stipulate that the survivor of them or one of them if
 he or she survives, will be entitled to the whole of the net acquisitions made by the other.
       It may also be agreed between the spouses that the one who, at the time of the dissolution of the regime, has
 against the other a claim for participation, may demand the giving in payment of certain property of the other spouse, if
 he or she establishes an essential interest in having it attributed to him or her.
        TITLE VI
        OF SALES
                CHAPTER I
                Of the Nature and Form of Sale
 Art. 1582
 Articles 1582 to 1701
 Articles 1582 to 1589-2
       A sale is an agreement by which one person binds himself to deliver a thing, and another to pay for it.
       It may be made by an authentic instrument or by an instrument under private signature.
 Art. 1583
       It is complete between the parties, and ownership is acquired as of right by the buyer with respect to the seller, as
 soon as the thing and the price have been agreed upon, although the thing has not yet been delivered or the price paid.
 Art. 1584
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 186/268
CIVIL CODE
       A sale may be made outright or subject to a condition either precedent or subsequent.
       It may also have as its object two or more alternative things.
       In all these cases, its effect is regulated by the general principles relating to agreements.
 Art. 1585
       Where goods are not sold in bulk but by weight, number or measure, a sale is not complete, in that the things sold
 are at the risk of the seller until they have been weighed, counted or measured; but the buyer may claim either the
 delivery or damages, if there is occasion, in case of non-performance of the undertaking.
 Art. 1586
       Where, on the contrary, the goods have been sold in bulk, the sale is complete although the goods have not yet
 been weighed, counted or measured.
 Art. 1587
       With respect to wine, oil and other things which it is customary to taste before buying them, there is no sale so long
 as the buyer has not tasted and accepted them.
 Art. 1588
       A sale made upon trial shall always be deemed made under a condition precedent.
 Art. 1589
       A promise of sale is the same as a sale, where there is reciprocal consent of both parties as to the thing and the
 price.
       (Act of 30 July 1930) Where that promise relates to plots already in lots or to be in lots, its acceptance and the
 agreement that will result therefrom shall be established by the payment of an instalment on the price, whatever the
 name given to that instalment may be, and by the vesting with possession of the plot.
       The date of the agreement, even put into legal form afterwards, is that of the payment of the first instalment.
 Art. 1589-1
 (Act no 2000-1208 of 13 Dec. 2000)
       Is rendered void any unilateral undertaking entered into for the purpose of acquiring an immovable property or right
 for which a payment is required or received from the person who binds himself, whatever the cause and the form thereof
 may be.
 Art. 1590
       Where a promise to sell was made with an earnest, each contracting party is at liberty to withdraw.
       The one who has given it, by losing it.
       And the one who has received it, by returning twice the amount.
 Art. 1591
       The price of a sale must be determined and stated by the parties.
 Art. 1592
       It may however left to the estimation of a third person; where that person is unwilling or unable to make an estimate,
 there is no sale.
 Art. 1593
       The costs of instruments and other accessory to a sale shall be charged to the buyer.
 Article 1589-2
 (Ord. no 2005-1512 of 7 Dec. 2005)
       Is void and of no effect a unilateral undertaking to sell relating to an immovable, business assets, a right to a lease
 concerning  the whole or part of an immovable or to the securities of the companies referred to in Articles 728 and 1655
 ter of the General Code of Taxation, where it is not established by an authentic instrument or by an instrument under
 private signature registrated within ten days as from the date of its acceptance by the beneficiary. So shall it be with any
 transfer relating to said undertakings which has not been the subject of an authentic instrument or of an instrument
 under private signature registrated within ten days as from its date.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Those Who May Buy and Sell
 Art. 1594
       All those to whom legislation does not forbid to do so may buy or sell.
 Art. 1595
       [repealed]
 Art. 1596
 Articles 1594 to 1597
       May not, either by themselves or through intermediaries, become purchasers, on pain of annulment:
       Guardians, as to the property of those under their guardianship;
       Agents, as to the property which they have charge of selling;
       Administrators, as to that of the communes or public institutions entrusted to their care;
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 187/268
CIVIL CODE
       Public officers, as to national property whose sale is made through their duties.
 Art. 1597
       Judges, [repealed by implication], members of the judiciary acting as Government procurators, registrars, bailiffs,
 avoués, counsels, advocates and notaires may not become assignees of suits, contested rights and actions which are
 within the jurisdiction of the court in the territory within which they exercise their duties, on pain of annulment, and of
 costs and damages.
                CHAPTER III
                Of Things Which May be Sold
 Art. 1598
 Articles 1598 to 1601
       Everything which may be the subject of legal transactions between private individuals may be sold, where special
 statutes do not prohibit their alienation.
 Art. 1599
       The sale of a thing belonging to another is void: it may give rise to damages where the buyer did not know that the
 thing belonged to another.
 Art. 1600
       [repealed]
 Art. 1601
       Where, at the time of the sale, the thing sold has wholly perished, the sale is void.
       Where only a part of the thing has perished, the buyer has the choice to waive the sale or to claim the part saved,
 by having the price determined proportionally.
                CHAPTER III-1
                Of the Sales of Buildings to be Erected
 Art. 1601-1
 Articles 1601-1 to
 1601-4
       The sale of a building to be erected is that by which the seller binds himself to erect a building within a period
 determined by the contract.
       It may be concluded for future delivery or in a future state of completion.
 Art. 1601-2
       A sale for future delivery is the contract by which the seller undertakes to deliver the building on its completion, and
 the buyer undertakes to take delivery of it and to pay the price of it at the date of delivery. The transfer of ownership is
 achieved by operation of law by the acknowledgement of the completion of the building through an authentic instrument;
 it is effective retroactively on the day of the sale.
 Art. 1601-3
       A sale in a future state of completion is the contract by which a seller transfers at once to the buyer his rights in the
 ground as well as the ownership of the existing structures. The works to come  become the property of the buyer as they
 proceed; the buyer is bound to pay the price of them as the work proceeds.
       The seller keeps the powers of a building owner until approval of the work.
 Art. 1601-4
       An assignment by a purchaser of the rights arising from a sale of a building to be erected substitutes by operation of
 law the assignee in the obligations of the buyer towards the seller.
       Where the sale was united with an agency, the latter continues between the seller and the assignee.
       Those provisions shall apply to any transfer inter vivos, voluntary or compulsory, or by reason of death.
                CHAPTER IV
                Of the Obligations of the Seller
 Art. 1602
       The seller is obliged to explain clearly what he binds himself to.
       Any obscure or ambiguous agreement shall be interpreted against the seller.
 Art. 1603
       He has two main obligations, that to deliver and that to warrant the thing which he sells.
                        SECTION I
                        General Provisions
                        SECTION II
                        Of Delivery
 Art. 1604
       Delivery is the transfer of the thing sold into the power and possession of the buyer.
 Articles 1604 to 1603
 Articles 1604 to 1624
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 188/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1605
       The obligation to deliver immovables is fulfilled on the part of the seller where he has handed over the keys, in case
 of a building, or where he has handed over the instruments of title.
 Art. 1606
       Delivery of movable effects is the outcome :
       Either of a real delivery;
       Or of the handing over of the keys of the buildings which contain them;
       Or even of the sole consent of the parties, where the transfer cannot take place at the time of the sale, or where the
 buyer already had them in his power on another basis.
 Art. 1607
       Delivery of intangible rights is made either by handing over the instruments of title, or by the use which the
 purchaser makes of them with the consent of the seller.
 Art. 1608
       The expenses of delivery shall be charged to the seller, and those of removal to the buyer, unless otherwise agreed.
 Art. 1609
       Delivery shall be made at the place where the thing sold was at the time of the sale, unless otherwise agreed.
 Art. 1610
       Where the seller fails to make delivery within the time agreed upon between the parties, the purchaser may, at his
 choice, apply for avoidance of the sale, or for his being vested with possession, if the delay results only from an act of
 the seller. 
Art. 1611
       In all cases, the seller shall be ordered to pay damages, where the purchaser has suffered a loss because of the
 failure to deliver at the agreed time.
 Art. 1612
       The seller is not obliged to deliver the thing where the buyer does not pay the price of it unless the seller has
 granted him time for the payment.
 Art. 1613
       Nor is he obliged to deliver, even if he has allowed time for the payment, where, since the sale, the buyer [is under a
 judicial arrangement] or insolvent, so that the seller is in imminent danger of losing the price; unless the buyer gives him
 security to pay at the time-limit.
 Art. 1614
       The thing must be delivered in the condition in which it is at the time of the sale.
       From that day, all the fruits belong to the purchaser.
 Art. 1615
       The obligation to deliver the thing includes its accessories and all that was designed for its perpetual use.
 Art. 1616
       The seller is obliged to deliver the capacity such as it is specified in the contract, subject to the modifications
 hereinafter expressed.
 Art. 1617
       Where the sale of an immovable was made with indication of the capacity, at the rate of so much for a measure, the
 seller is obliged to deliver to the purchaser, if the latter so requires, the quantity stated in the contract;
       And if he cannot do so, or if the purchaser does not so require, the seller is obliged to suffer a proportionate
 reduction in price.
 Art. 1618
       Where, on the contrary, in the case or the preceding Article, the capacity is greater than the one stated in the
 contract, the purchaser has the choice to provide the surplus of the price, or to repudiate the contract, if the excess is
 one-twentieth above the capacity declared.
 Art. 1619
       In all other cases,
       Whether the sale is made of a definite and limited thing,
       Whether it has as its object distinct and separate tenements,
       Whether it begins with the measure, or by the designation of the property sold followed by the measure,
       The expression of that measure does not give rise to any increase of price, in favour of the seller for the excess of
 measure, or in favour of the purchaser, to any diminution in price for lesser measure, unless the difference between the
 actual measure and the one expressed in the contract is of one-twentieth more or less, with regard to the value of all the
 things sold, unless otherwise stipulated.
 Art. 1620
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 189/268
CIVIL CODE
       In the case where, under the preceding Article, it is necessary to raise the price for excess of measure, the
 purchaser has the choice either to repudiate the contract or to provide the surplus of the price, with interest if he has
 kept the immovable.
 Art. 1621
       In all cases in which the purchaser is entitled to repudiate the contract, the seller is bound to return to him, besides
 the price, if he has received it, the costs of the contract. 
Art. 1622
       An action for an increase of price, on the part of the seller, and that for a diminution in price or for termination of the
 contract, on the part of the buyer, must be brought within the year, after the day of the contract, on pain of lapse.
 Art. 1623
       Where two tenements have been sold by the same contract for one and the same price, with the designation of the
 measures of each of them, and where there is less capacity in the one, and more in the other, set-off is made up to the
 amount due; and an action, either for an increase, or for a diminution in price, takes place only in accordance with the
 rules above laid down.
 Art. 1624
       The question of ascertaining upon whom, between the seller and the purchaser, falls the loss or deterioration of the
 thing sold before its delivery, shall be decided according to the rules prescribed in the Title Of Contracts or of
 Conventional Obligations in General.
                        SECTION III
                        Of Warranty
                                Paragraph 1
                                Of Warranty against Dispossession
 Art. 1625
 Articles 1625 to 1649
 Articles 1625 to 1640.
       The warranty which the seller owes to the purchaser has two objects: the first is the peaceful possession of the
 thing sold; the second, the latent defects of that thing, or redhibitory vices.
 Art. 1626
       Although no stipulation as to warranty has been made at the time of the sale, the seller is obliged as of right to
 warrant the purchaser against a dispossession of the thing sold which he may suffer in whole or in part, or against
 encumbrances alleged on that thing, and not declared at the time of the sale.
 Art. 1627
       The parties may, by particular agreements, add to this obligation of right or diminish its effect; they may even agree
 that the seller may not be subject to any warranty.
 Art. 1628
       Although it be said that the seller may not be subject to any obligation, he nevertheless remains liable to that which
 results from an act which is his own; any agreement to the contrary is void.
 Art. 1629
       In the same case of stipulation of no warranty, the seller, in case of dispossession, is bound to return the price,
 unless the purchaser knew, at the time of the sale, of the danger of dispossession, or unless he bought at his own risk.
 Art. 1630
       If a warranty has been promised, or if no stipulation was made in this respect, where the purchaser is dispossessed,
 he is entitled to claim against the seller:
       1° The return of the price;
       2° That of the fruits where he is obliged to return them to the owner who dispossesses him;
       3° The expenses incurred in relation with the warranty claim of the buyer, and those incurred by the original plaintiff;
       4° Finally, damages, as well as the expenses and proper costs of the contract.
 Art. 1631
       Where, at the time of dispossession, the thing sold has decreased in value or has been significantly damaged,
 either owing to the negligent conduct of the buyer, or by accidents of force majeure, the seller nevertheless is bound to
 return the whole price.
 Art. 1632
       But if the purchaser has derived some profit from the dilapidations made by him, the seller is entitled to retain from
 the price a sum equal to that profit.
 Art. 1633
       Where the thing sold has increased in price at the time of the dispossession, even independently from an act of the
 purchaser, the seller is obliged to pay him what it is worth above the price of the sale.
 Art. 1634
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 190/268
CIVIL CODE
       A seller is bound to repay the purchaser or to make the person who dispossesses him repay him for all the useful
 repairs and improvements which he has made on the tenement.
 Art. 1635
       Where a seller has sold the tenement of another in bad faith, he is obliged to repay the purchaser for all the
 expenses, even for luxury or pleasure, which the latter may have made on the tenement.
 Art. 1636
       Where a purchaser is dispossessed from only part of the thing, which is of such importance, in proportion to the
 whole, that the purchaser would not have bought without the part of which he is dispossessed, he may have the sale
 terminated.
 Art. 1637
       Where, in case of dispossession of part of a tenement sold, the sale is not terminated, the value of the part of which
 the purchaser is dispossessed shall be reimbursed to him according to an appraisal at the time of the dispossession,
 and not in proportion to the total price of the sale, whether the thing sold has increased or decreased in value.
 Art. 1638
       Where a property sold is, without any declaration having been made, encumbered with non-apparent servitudes
 which are of such importance that it is to be presumed that the purchaser would not have bought if he had known of
 them, he may apply for termination of the contract, unless he prefers to content himself with an indemnity.
 Art. 1639
       The other questions to which damages resulting for the purchaser from the non-performance of the sale may give
 rise shall be decided in accordance with the general rules established in the Title Of Contracts and of  Conventional
 Obligations in General.
 Art. 1640.
       -A warranty against dispossession ceases where the purchaser has allowed a final judgment, or a judgment no
 longer appealable, to be handed down against him without joining his seller in the proceedings, if the latter proves that
 there were sufficient grounds to have the action dismissed.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of Warranty against the Defects of the Thing Sold
 Art. 1641
 Articles 1641 to 1649
       A seller is bound to a warranty on account of the latent defects of the thing sold which render it unfit for the use for
 which it was intended, or which so impair that use that the buyer would not have acquired it, or would only have given a
 lesser price for it, had he known of them.
 Art. 1642
       A seller is not liable for defects which are patent and which the buyer could ascertain for himself.
 Art. 1642-1
 (Act no 67-547 of 7 July 1967)
       The seller of a building to be erected may not be discharged, either before approval of the work, or before the expiry
 of a period of one month after the vesting of the purchaser into possession, for defects of construction then patent.
       There may be no occasion for avoidance of the contract or for diminution in price where the seller binds himself to
 repair the defect.
 Art. 1643
       He is liable for latent defects, even though he did not know of them, unless he has stipulated that he would not be
 bound to any warranty in that case.
 Art. 1644
       In the cases of Articles 1641 and 1643, the buyer has the choice either of returning the thing and having the price
 repaid to him or of keeping the thing and having a part of the price repaid to him, as appraised by experts.
 Art. 1645
       Where the seller knew of the defects of the thing, he is liable, in addition to restitution of the price which he received
 from him, for all damages towards the buyer.
 Art. 1646
       Where the seller did not know of the defects of the thing, he is only liable for restitution of the price and for
 reimbursing the buyer for the costs occasioned by the sale.
 Art. 1646-1
 (Act no 78-12 of 4 Jan. 1978)
       The seller of a building to be erected is liable, from the approval of the work, for the obligations for which the
 architects, contractors and other persons bound towards the building owner by a contract of hiring of industry and
 services are themselves liable under Articles 1792, 1792-1, 1792-2 and 1792-3 of this Code.
       Those warranties benefit the successive owners of the building.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 191/268
CIVIL CODE
       There may be no occasion for avoidance of the sale or diminution in price where the seller binds himself to repair
 the damages specified in Articles 1792, 1792-1 and 1792-2 of this Code and to take upon himself the warranty provided
 for in Article 1792-3.
 Art. 1647
       Where the thing which had defects perishes because of its bad quality, the loss falls upon the seller who is liable to
 the buyer for restitution of the price and other compensations explained in the two preceding Articles [Articles 1645 and
 1646].
       But a loss occasioned by a fortuitous event falls upon the buyer.
 Art. 1648
       The action resulting from redhibitory vices must be brought by the buyer"within a period of two years following the
 discovery of the vice" (Ord. no 2005-136 of 17 Feb. 2005).
       (Act no 67-547 of 7 July 1967) In the case provided for in Article 1642-1, the action must be brought, under pain of
 being time-barred, within the year following the date on which the seller may be discharged from patent defects.
 Art. 1649
       It does nor take place with regard to sales made by order of the court.
                CHAPTER V
                Of the Obligations of the Buyer
 Art. 1650
 Articles 1650 to 1657
       The main obligation of the buyer is to pay the price on the day and at the place fixed by the sale.
 Art. 1651
       Where nothing has been fixed in this regard at the time of the sale, the buyer must pay at the place and at the time
 where and when delivery is to be made.
 Art. 1652
       The buyer owes interest on the price of the sale up to the time of the payment, in the three following cases:
       Where it has been so agreed at the time of the sale;
       Where the thing sold and delivered produces fruits or other incomes;
       Where the buyer is under notice to pay.
       In that last case, interest runs only from the notice.
 Art. 1653
       Where the buyer is disturbed or rightly fears that he will be disturbed by an action, either for a mortgage  or for
 recovery of property, he may suspend the payment of the price until the seller has caused the disturbance to cease,
 unless the latter prefers to give security, or unless it was stipulated that the buyer will pay notwithstanding a disturbance.
 Art. 1654
       Where the buyer does not pay the price, the seller may apply for avoidance of the sale.
 Art. 1655
       The avoidance of a sale of immovables  shall be ordered at once where the seller is in danger of losing the thing
 and the price.
       Where that danger does not exist, the judge may grant the purchaser a period more or less long according to the
 circumstances.
       Where that period expires without the buyer having paid, the avoidance of the sale shall be ordered.
 Art. 1656
       Where it has been stipulated at the time of the sale of immovables that, failing payment within the period agreed
 upon, the sale will be avoided by operation of law, the purchaser may nevertheless pay after the expiry of the period, so
 long as he is not given notice by a demand for payment; but, after that demand, the judge may not grant him any period.
 Art. 1657
       In matters of sale of commodities and movable effects, the avoidance of the sale takes place by operation of law,
 and without any demand, for the benefit of the seller, after the expiry of the period agreed  upon for the removal.
                CHAPTER VI
                Of Avoidance and Rescission of Sales
 Art. 1658
 Articles 1659 to 1658
       Independently of the grounds for annulment or avoidance already explained in this Title, and of those which are
 common to all agreements, a contract of sale may be avoided through the exercise of a power of redemption and on
 account of the cheapness of the price.
                        SECTION I
                        Of Power of Redemption
 Art. 1659
 Articles 1659 to 1673
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 192/268
CIVIL CODE
       A power of redemption or repurchase is an agreement by which the seller reserves to himself the taking back of the
 thing sold, through restitution of the purchase price, and the reimbursement which Article 1673 deals with.
 Art. 1660
       A power of redemption may not be stipulated for a time exceeding five years.
       Where it has been stipulated for a longer time, it shall be reduced to that time.
 Art. 1661
       The time fixed is of the essence and may not be extended by the judge.
 Art. 1662
       Where the seller has not exercised his power of redemption within the time fixed, the purchaser remains the
 irrevocable owner.
 Art. 1663
       The time runs against all persons, even against a minor, subject to a remedy against those whom it may concern, if
 there is occasion.
 Art. 1664
       The seller under a clause of redemption may exercise his power against a second purchaser, even when the power
 of redemption has not been declared in the second contract.
 Art. 1665
       The purchaser under a clause of redemption exercises all the rights of his seller; he may acquire ownership by
 prescription both against the true owner and against those who claim rights or mortgages on the thing sold.
 Art. 1666
       He may oppose the benefit of seizure and sale against the creditors of his seller.
 Art. 1667
       Where the purchaser under a clause of redemption of an undivided part of a property becomes the successful
 bidder for the whole in an auction sale induced against him, he may compel the seller to take back the whole when the
 latter wishes to make use of the clause.
 Art. 1668
       Where several persons have jointly sold, and by a same contract, a common property, each may exercise the
 power of redemption only for the share which he had in it.
 Art. 1669
       It shall be the same where the person who has sold a property alone has left several heirs.
       Each one of these co-heirs may make use of the power of redemption only for the share he takes in the succession.
 Art. 1670
       But, in the case of the two preceding Articles, the purchaser may demand that all the co-sellers or all the co-heirs be
 joined in the proceedings in order to agree between them as to the redemption of the whole property; and where they do
 not agree, their action shall be dismissed.
 Art. 1671
       Where the sale of a property belonging to several persons has not been jointly made and of the whole property
 together, and where each  has only sold the share which he had therein, they may exercise separately the power of
 redemption on the portion which belonged to them;
       And the purchaser may not compel the one who enforces it in that way to redeem the whole.
 Art. 1672
       Where the purchaser has left several heirs, the power of redemption may be exercised against each of them only
 for his share, in the case where it is still undivided, and in that where the thing sold has been partitioned between them.
       But, where a partition of the succession has taken place, and the property sold has fallen to the share of one of
 them, the power of redemption may be exercised against him for the whole.
 Art. 1673
       A seller who makes use of a clause of redemption shall reimburse not only the purchase price, but also the
 expenses and fair costs of the sale, the necessary repairs and those which have increased the value of the tenement,
 up to the amount of that increase. He may be vested into possession only after having discharged all those obligations.
       (Ord. no 59-71 of 7 Jan. 1959) Where the seller comes into his property again through the effect of a clause of
 redemption, he retakes it free of all encumbrances and mortgages with which the purchaser may have burdened it,
 provided that the clause has been duly registered at the land registry, before the registration of the said encumbrances
 and mortgages. He is bound to carry out the leases made without fraud by the purchaser.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Rescission of Sales because of Loss
 Art. 1674
 Articles 1674 to 1685
       Where a seller has suffered a loss greater than seven-twelfths of the price of an immovable, he is entitled to apply
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 193/268
CIVIL CODE
 for the rescission of the sale, even though he may have expressly renounced in the contract the faculty of applying for
 that rescission and have declared to donate the surplus.
 Art. 1675
       In order to ascertain whether there has been a loss of the seven-twelfths, the immovable must be appraised
 according to its condition and its value at the time of the sale.
       (Act of 28 Nov. 1949) In the case of a unilateral promise of sale, the loss is appraised on the day of its execution.
 Art. 1676
       The claim is no longer admissible after the expiry of two years, after the day of the sale.
       That time runs against [married women, repealed by implication], and against absentees, adults in guardianship and
 minors coming in the right of an adult who has sold.
       That time also runs and is not suspended during the period stipulated for a clause of redemption.
 Art. 1677
       Proof of loss may be allowed only through judgment, and in the case only where the facts alleged are probable and
 serious enough to induce a presumption of loss.
 Art. 1678
       That proof may be adduced only through a report drawn by three experts who are obliged to make a single joint
 memorandum, and to give but a single opinion by a plurality of votes.
 Art. 1679
       Where there are different opinions, the memorandum shall contain the reasons thereof, but it shall not be allowed to
 disclose the opinion of each expert.
 Art. 1680
       The three experts shall be appointed by the court, unless the parties have agreed to appoint all three jointly.
 Art. 1681
       In the case where the action for rescission is entertained, the purchaser has the choice, either to return the thing
 while taking back the price which he paid for it, or to keep the tenement while paying the balance of the fair price, after
 deducting one-tenth of the total price.
       A third party in possession has the same right, save his warranty against his seller.
 Art. 1682
       Where the purchaser prefers to keep the thing by paying the balance specified by the preceding Article, he owes the
 interest of that balance, from the day of the claim for rescission.
       Where he prefers to return it and to take back the price, he shall return the fruits from the day of the claim.
       Interest on the price which he has paid is also counted for him from the day of the same claim, or from the day of
 payment, where he has not collected any fruits.
 Art. 1683
       Rescission for loss does not take place in favour of the buyer.
 Art. 1684
       It does not take place in any sale which, according to law, may only be made by order of the court.
 Art. 1685
       The rules explained in the preceding Section for cases in which several persons have sold jointly or separately, and
 for the one in which the purchaser has left several heirs, shall likewise be complied with when bringing  an action for
 rescission.
                CHAPTER VII
                Of Auction
 Art. 1686
 Articles 1686 to 1688
       Where a thing common to several persons cannot be partitioned conveniently and without loss;
       Or where, in a partition of property in common made amicably, there is any property which none of the coparceners
 can or wishes to take,
       A sale thereof shall be made by auction and the proceeds shall be distributed between the co-owners.
 Art. 1687
       Each co-owner is at liberty to request that outsiders be given notice of the sale: they shall necessarily be given
 notice where one of the co-owners is a minor.
 Art. 1688
       The method and formalities to be complied with for an auction are explained in the Title Of Successions and in the
 Code of Civil Procedure.
                CHAPTER VIII
                Of Assignment of Claims and Other Incorporeal Rights
 Articles 1689 to 1701
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 194/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1689
       In case of assignment of a claim, or of a right or of an action against a third party, delivery takes place between the
 assignor and the assignee by handing over the instrument of title.
 Art. 1690
       An assignee is vested with regard to third parties only by notice of the assignment served upon the debtor.
       Nevertheless, the assignee may likewise be vested by acceptance of the assignment given by the debtor in an
 authentic act.
 Art. 1691
       Where, before the debtor has been given notice by the assignor or the assignee, the debtor has paid the assignor,
 he is lawfully discharged.
 Art. 1692
       The sale or assignment of a claim includes the accessories of the claim, such as security, prior charges and
 mortgages.
 Art. 1693
       A person who sells a claim or any other incorporeal right must warrant its existence at the time of the assignment,
 even though it is made without warranty.
 Art. 1694
       He is responsible for the solvency of the debtor only where he has bound himself thereto, and only up to the amount
 of the price which he has received for the claim.
 Art. 1695
       Where he has promised the solvency of the debtor, that promise only relates to the present solvency, and does not
 extend to the future, unless the assignor has expressly so stipulated.
 Art. 1696
       A person who sells an inheritance without specifying its contents in detail, is bound to warrant only his capacity as
 heir.
 Art. 1697
       If he had already benefited by fruits of some tenement or received the amount of some claim belonging to that
 inheritance, or sold some effects of the succession, he is bound to reimburse the purchaser therefor, unless he has
 expressly reserved them at the time of the sale.
 Art. 1698
       The purchaser must on his part reimburse the seller for what the latter has paid for the debts and charges of the
 succession, and recompense him for everything for which he was creditor, unless otherwise stipulated.
 Art. 1699
       A person against whom a litigious right has been assigned may have himself released by the assignee by
 reimbursing him for the actual price of the assignment with the expenses and fair costs, and with interest from the day
 when the assignee has paid the price of the assignment made to him.
 Art. 1700
       A matter is deemed litigious as soon as there is a case and controversy as to the merits of the right.
 Art. 1701
       The provision laid down in Article 1699 shall not apply:
       1° In the case where the assignment has been made to a co-heir or co-owner of the right assigned;
       2° Where it has been made to a creditor in payment of what is due to him;
       3° Where it has been made to the possessor of the property to which the litigious right relates.
        TITLE VII
        OF EXCHANGES
 Art. 1702
       An exchange is a contract by which the parties give to each other one thing for another.
 Art. 1703
 Articles 1702 to 1707
       An exchange is the outcome of the sole consent of the parties, in the same manner as a sale.
 Art. 1704
       Where one of the exchangers has already received the thing given to him in exchange and he proves afterwards
 that the other contracting party is not the owner of that thing, he may not be compelled to deliver the thing that he has
 promised in mutual exchange, but only to return the thing which he has received.
 Art. 1705
       The exchanger who is dispossessed of the thing which he has received in exchange has the choice between
 claiming damages or claiming back his thing.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 195/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1706
       Rescission on account of loss does not take place in contracts of exchange.
 Art. 1707
       All the other rules laid down for contracts of sale shall apply to exchanges as to other issues.
        TITLE VIII
        OF HIRING
                CHAPTER I
                General Provisions
 Art. 1708
       There are two kinds of contracts of hiring:
       One for things,
       And one for work.
 Art. 1709
 Articles 1708 to 1831
 Articles 1708 to 1712
       The hiring of things is a contract by which one of the parties binds himself to have the other enjoy a thing during a
 certain time, and at a charge of a certain price which the latter binds himself to pay him.
 Art. 1710
       The hiring of work is a contract by which one of the parties binds himself to do something for the other, at a charge
 of a price agreed between them.
 Art. 1711
       These two modes of hiring are further subdivided into several particular kinds:
       The hiring of houses and movables is called a lease for rent;
       That of rural property, an agricultural lease;
       That of work or of service, a hire;
       That of animals of which the profits are divided between the owner and the one to whom he entrusts them, a
 livestock lease;
       Estimates, contracts or fixed bargains, for the undertaking of a work at a charge of a determined price, are also
 hiring, where the material is provided by the one for whom the work is done.
       These last three kinds have special rules.
 Art. 1712
       Leases of national property, of the property of communes and public institutions are subject to special rules.
                CHAPTER II
                Of the Rental of Things
 Art. 1713
       One may rent all kinds of property, movables and immovables.
                        SECTION I
                        Of Rules Common to Leases of Houses and of Rural Property
 Art. 1714
 (Ord. of 17 Oct. 1945; Act no 46-682 of 13 April 1946)
 Articles 1714 to 1713
 Articles 1714 to 1751
       One may lease either in writing or verbally, except, as regards rural property, for the application of the rules
 particular to agricultural leases and sharecropping.
 Art. 1715
       Where a lease made without any writing has not yet been carried out, and one of the parties denies it, proof may not
 be adduced through witnesses, however moderate the price may be, and although it is alleged that a deposit was paid.
       Oath may be tendered only to the one who denies the lease.
 Art. 1716
       Where there is a controversy as to the price of a verbal lease which is being carried out, and there is no receipt, the
 owner shall be believed upon his oath, unless the tenant prefers to apply for an appraisal by experts; in which case, the
 costs of the appraisement shall be charged to him, if the   appraisal exceeds the price which he has declared.
 Art. 1717
       A lessee has the right to sublet or even to assign his lease to another person, unless that faculty has been forbidden
 to him.
       It may be forbidden wholly or in part.
       Such a clause is always strict.
 Art. 1718
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       The provisions of Article 595, paragraphs 2 and 3, relating to leases made by usufructuaries shall apply to leases

 made by a guardian without authorization of the family council.
 Art. 1719
       A lessor is bound, by the nature of the contract, and without need of any particular stipulation:
       1° To deliver the thing leased to the lessee “and, where the main dwelling of the latter is concerned, a decent
 lodging” (Act no 2000-1208 of 13Dec. 2000);
       2° To maintain that thing in order so that it can serve the use for which it has been let;
       3° To secure to the lessee a peaceful enjoyment for the duration of the lease;
       4° (Act no 46-682 of 13 April 1946) To secure also the permanence and quality of plantings.
 Art. 1720
       A lessor is bound to deliver the thing in good repair of whatever character.
       He must, during the term of the lease, make all the repairs which may become necessary, other than those
 incumbent upon lessees.
 Art. 1721
       A warranty is due to the tenant for all vices or defects of the thing leased which prevent use of it, although the lessor
 did not know of them at the time of the lease.
       Where any loss results to the lessee from those vices or defects, the lessor is obliged to indemnify him.
 Art. 1722
       Where, during the term of the lease, the thing leased is wholly destroyed by a fortuitous event, the lease is
 terminated by operation of law; where it is destroyed only in part, the lessee may, according to the circumstances, apply
 either for a reduction in price, or even for termination of the lease. In either case, no compensation is owed.
 Art. 1723
       A lessor may not, during the term of the lease, change the form of the thing leased.
 Art. 1724
       Where, during the lease, the thing leased needs urgent repairs which cannot be postponed until its end, the lessee
 must bear them, whatever inconvenience they cause him and although he is deprived of a part of the thing leased while
 they are being made.
       But where those repairs last more than forty days, the rent shall be reduced in proportion to the time and to the part
 of the thing leased of which he has been deprived.
       Where the repairs are of such a nature that they render uninhabitable what is required for the lodging of the lessee
 and his family, he may have the lease terminated.
 Art. 1725
       A lessor is not bound to warrant the lessee against disturbance which third persons cause to his enjoyment by
 assault, without claiming  in other respects any right to the thing leased; but the lessee may proceed against them in his
 own name.
 Art. 1726
       Where, on the contrary, the tenant or the farmer have been disturbed in their enjoyment in consequence of an
 action relating to the ownership of the tenement, they are entitled to a proportionate reduction of the rent of the lease or
 agricultural lease, provided that a notice of the disturbance and of the impediment has been served upon the owner.
 Art. 1727
       Where those who have committed assault claim to have some right to the property leased, or where the lessee
 himself is summoned in court to be ordered to relinquish all or part of that thing, or to suffer the exercise of some
 servitude, he must have the lessor made a party to warranty proceedings and shall be left out of the action, if he so
 demands, by naming the lessor on whose behalf he possesses.
 Art. 1728
       A lessee is bound to two main obligations:
       1° To make use of the thing leased as a prudent administrator and according to the purposes intended by the lease,
 or according to those presumed under the circumstances, failing an agreement;
       2° To pay the rent at the agreed times.
 Art. 1729
       Where the lessee uses the thing leased for another use than the one for which it was intended, or from which
 damage may result to the lessor, the latter may, according to the circumstances, have the lease terminated.
 Art. 1730
       Where an inventory of fixtures has been made between the lessor and the lessee, the latter must return the thing
 such as he received it, according to that inventory, except for what has perished or has been deteriorated through decay
 or force majeure.
 Art. 1731
       Where no inventory has been made, the lessee is presumed to have received the premises in a good state of
 repairs incumbent upon lessees, and must return them in the same state, except for proof to the contrary.

 Art. 1732
       He is answerable for the deteriorations or losses occurring during his enjoyment, unless he proves that they took
 place without his fault.
 Art. 1733
       He is answerable for fire, unless he proves:
       That the fire happened by a fortuitous event or force majeure, or by a defect of construction, or
       That the fire was communicated through a neighbouring  house.
 Art. 1734
 (Act of 5 Jan. 1883)
       Where there are several tenants, they are all liable for a fire in proportion to the rental value of the part of the
 building which they occupy;
       Unless they prove that the fire has originated in the dwelling of one of them, in which case, that one alone is liable;
 or
       Unless some of them prove that the fire could not have started with them, in which case those ones are not liable.
 Art. 1735
       A lessee is responsible for the deteriorations and losses which occur through the act of  persons of his house or of
 his sub-tenants.
 Art. 1736
       Where a lease was made without writing, one of the parties may give the other notice to quit only by observing the
 period fixed by the usage of the place.
 Art. 1737
       A lease ceases by operation of law at the expiry of the term fixed, where it has been made in writing, without it being
 necessary to give notice to quit.

       Where, at the expiry of written leases, the lessee remains and is left in possession, a new lease takes place, whose
 effect is regulated by the Article relating to leases made without writing.
 Art. 1739
       Where a notice to quit has been served, the lessee, although he has continued his enjoyment, may not invoke a
 tacit renewal.
 Art. 1740
       In the case of the two preceding Articles, a security given for a lease does not extend to the obligations resulting
 from an extension.
 Art. 1741
       A contract of lease is terminated by the loss of the thing leased and by the respective failure of the lessor and the
 lessee to perform their undertakings.
 Art. 1742
       A contract of lease is not terminated by the death of the lessor or by that of the lessee.
 Art. 1743
 (Ord. no 45-2380 of 17 Oct. 1945; Act no 46-682 of 13 April 1946)
       Where a lessor sells a thing leased, the purchaser may not evict the agricultural tenant, sharecropper or tenant who

       He may, however, evict a tenant of non-rural property where he has reserved that right by the contract of lease.
 Art. 1744
 (Ord. no 45-2380 of 17 Oct. 1945)
       Where it was agreed at the time of the lease that in case of sale, the purchaser would be allowed to evict the lessee

 Art. 1745
       In case of a house, apartment or shop, the lessor shall pay to the evicted tenant, as damages, a sum equal to the

 departure.

 Art. 1747
       Where manufactures, factories or other establishments which require large advances are concerned, the indemnity

 dwelling of two spouses and even where the lease was concluded before the marriage, is, whatever their matrimonial
 regime may be and notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, considered to belong to both spouses.
       In case of divorce or judicial separation, that right may be allotted by the court seized of the application for divorce
 or judicial separation, on account of the social and family interests concerned, to one of the spouses, subject to the
 rights to reimbursement or indemnity for the benefit of the other spouse.
       (Act no 2001-1135 of 3 Dec. 2001) In case of death of one of the spouses, the surviving spouse co-lessee has an
 exclusive right on it, except where he or she expressly renounces it.

 security to answer for the rent.
 Art. 1753
       A sub-tenant is liable to the owner only up to the amount of the price of his sub-lease which he may owe at the time
 of the seizure, without his being allowed to set off payments made in advance.
       Payments made by a sub-tenant either under a stipulation contained in his lease, or as a consequence of the usage
 of the place, are not deemed to be made in advance.
 Art. 1754
       Repairs incumbent upon the tenant or those of routine maintenance for which a tenant is responsible, unless

 Art. 1759
       Where the tenant of a house or a flat continues his enjoyment after the expiry of the lease in writing, without

 of the place.

 Art. 1763
       [repealed]
 Art. 1764
 Articles 1763 to 1778
       In case of breach, the owner is entitled to re-enter into enjoyment and the lessee shall be ordered to pay the
 damages resulting from the non-performance of the lease.
 Art. 1765
       Where, in an agricultural lease, tenements are given a lesser or greater capacity than the one they really have,
 there is occasion for an increase or a decrease  in price for the farmer only in the cases and under the conditions
 expressed in the Title Of Sales.
 Art. 1766
       Where the lessee of a rural property does not furnish it with cattle and implements necessary for its farming, where
 he abandons cultivating, where he does not cultivate as a prudent owner, where he makes of the thing leased a use
 other than that for which it was intended, or, in general, where he does not comply with the terms of the lease and the
 lessor suffers a loss thereby, the lessor may, according to the circumstances, have the lease terminated. 
       In case of termination owing to an act of the lessee, he is liable for damages, as is stated in Article 1764.
 Art. 1767
       Any lesser of rural property is bound to store the crops in the place provided for that purpose according to the lease.
 Art. 1768
       A lessee of rural property is bound to give notice to the owner of all encroachments which may be committed
 against the tenements, on pain of all costs and damages.
       That notice must be given within the same period as that fixed for the case of an originating claim according to the
 distance between places.
 Art. 1769
       Where the lease is made for several years, and, during the term of lease, the whole or half of a crop at least is
 carried off by fortuitous events, the farmer may ask for a rebate of the price of the lease, unless he is compensated by
 the preceding crops.
       Where he is not compensated, the appraisal of the rebate may take place only at the end of the lease, at which
 time, a set-off shall be made of all the years of enjoyment;
       And nevertheless the judge may temporarily exempt the lessee from paying a part of the price by reason of the loss
 suffered.
 Art. 1770
       Where a lease is only for one year, and the loss is of the whole or at least of half the fruits, the lessee is discharged
 from a proportionate part of the price of the rent.
       He may not claim any rebate where the loss is of less than one-half.
 Art. 1771
       A farmer may not obtain any rebate where the loss of the fruits occurs after they have been separated from the
 ground, unless the lease gives the owner a share of the crop in kind; in which case, the owner must bear his share of
 the loss, provided the lessee was not under notice to deliver his share of the crop to him.
       Neither may a farmer ask for a rebate, where the cause of the damage existed and was known at the time when the
 lease was made.
 Art. 1772
       A lessee may be made responsible for fortuitous events by an express stipulation.
 Art. 1773
       That stipulation shall only apply to ordinary fortuitous events, such as hail, lightning, frost or failure of the crop.
       It may not extend to extraordinary fortuitous events, such as the ravages of war, or a flood, to which the country is
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 200/268
CIVIL CODE
 not ordinarily subject, unless the lessee has been made responsible for all the fortuitous events, foreseen or unforeseen.
 Art. 1774
       An unwritten lease of a rural tenement, is deemed made for the time which is necessary in order that the lessee
 collects all the fruits of the property farmed.
       Thus an agricultural lease of a field, of a vineyard, and of any other tenement whose fruits are collected in whole
 during the course of a year, is deemed made for one year.
       A lease of arable lands, where they are divided by break or season, is deemed made for as many years as there
 are breaks.
 Art. 1775
 (Act of 15 July 1942)
       A lease of rural properties, although unwritten, ceases at the expiry of the time specified by the preceding Article
 only through the effect of a written notice to quit given by one of the parties to the other, six months at least before that
 time.
       Failing a notice to quit given in the time above specified, a new lease takes place whose effect is regulated by
 Article 1774.
       It shall be the same where, at the expiry of written leases, the lessee remains and is left in possession.
 Art. 1776
       [repealed]
 Art. 1777
       A departing farmer must leave to the one who succeeds him in the cultivation, suitable lodging and other facilities
 for the work of the following year; and reciprocally, the entering farmer must provide the one who is departing with
 suitable lodging and other facilities for the consumption of fodder and for harvests which remain to be made.
       In either case, the usage of the place must be complied with.
 Art. 1778
       A departing farmer must also leave the straws and manure of the year, where he has received them on entering into
 possession; and even where he did not receive them, the owner may retain them according to his appraisal.
                CHAPTER III
                Of the Hiring of Industry and Services
 Art. 1779
       There are three main kinds of hiring of industry and services:
       1° The hiring of workers who enter the service of someone;
       2° That of carriers, as well by land as by water, who undertake to carry persons or goods;
 Articles 1780 to 1779
       3° (Act no 67-3 of 3 Jan. 1967) That of architects, contractors for work and technicians following research, estimates
 or contracts.

                        Of the Hiring of Servants and Workers
 Art. 1780
       One person may engage his services only for a time , or for a specified undertaking.
 Articles 1780 to 1781
       (Act of 27 Dec. 1890) The hiring of services made without determination of duration may always cease through the
 wish of one of the contracting parties.
       Nevertheless, the termination of the contract through the wish of one only of the contracting parties may give rise to
 damages.
       To fix the compensation to be granted, if any, account shall be taken of usages, of the nature of the services hired,
 of the time elapsed, of the deductions made and of the payments made in view of a retirement pension, and, in general,
 of all the circumstances which may establish the existence and determine the extent of the loss caused.
       The parties may not renounce in advance the contingent right to claim damages under the above provisions.
       The controversies to which the application of the preceding paragraphs may give rise, when they are brought before
 civil courts and before courts of appeal, shall be prepared for trial as summary proceedings and tried as emergencies.

 Articles 1782 to 1786

 them, to the same obligations as innkeepers who are dealt with in the Title Of Deposits and of Sequestration.

       They answer not only for what they have already received in their boat or carriage, but also for what has been
 delivered to them in port or in warehouse, to be placed in their boat or carriage.

 Art. 1787

 delivered, the loss falls upon the worker, unless the master was given notice to receive the thing.
 Art. 1789
       In case the worker furnishes his work only, if the thing happens to perish, the workman is liable for his fault only.
 Art. 1790
       Where, in the case of the preceding Article, the thing happens to perish, although without any fault on the worker's
 part, before the work was received, and without the master being given notice to check it, the worker may not claim any
 wages, unless the thing has perished through defect of the material.
 Art. 1791
       Where a work for several pieces or by measure is concerned, it may be checked by parts: checking is deemed to
 have been made for all the parts paid, if the master pays the worker in proportion to the work done. 
Art. 1792
 (Act no 78-12 of 4 Jan. 1978)

 a defect of the ground, which imperil the strength of the building or which, affecting it in one of its constituent parts or
 one of its elements of equipment, render it unsuitable for its purposes.

                Of Leases of Livestock
                        SECTION I
                        General Provisions
 Art. 1800
 Articles 1800 to 1831
 Articles 1800 to 1803
       A lease of livestock is a contract by which one of the parties gives the other a stock of cattle to be kept, fed and
 cared for, under the terms agreed between them.
 Art. 1801
       There are several kinds of leases of livestock:
       Simple or ordinary lease of livestock,
       Lease of livestock by halves,
       Lease of livestock given to a farmer or sharecropper.
       There is also a fourth kind of contract improperly named lease of livestock.
 Art. 1802
       A lease of livestock may be made for any kind of animals capable of increase or of profit for agriculture or trade.
 Art. 1803
       Failing special agreement, those contracts are regulated by the following principles.

 Art. 1804
 Articles 1804 to 1817
       An ordinary lease of livestock is a contract by which one person gives another cattle to be kept, fed and cared for,
 on condition that the lessee will profit from half the increase in stock and will also bear one-half of the loss.
 Art. 1805
 (Act of 9 June 1941)
       The statement of the number, description and appraisal of the animals delivered, which appears in the lease, does
 not transfer ownership of them to the lessee. It has no other purpose than to be used as basis for the settlement to occur
 on the day when the contract comes to an end.
 Art. 1806
       A lessee is bound to give the care of a prudent owner to the preservation of the livestock.
 Art. 1807
       He is liable for a fortuitous event only where it was preceded by some fault on his part, without which the loss would
 not have occurred.
 Art. 1808
       In case of dispute, the lessee is bound to prove the fortuitous event, and the lessor is bound to prove the fault which
 he ascribes to the lessee.
 Art. 1809
       A lessee who is discharged by a fortuitous event is always bound to account for the hides of the animals.
 Art. 1810
 (Act of 5 Nov. 1941)

       Where only a part of it perishes, the loss is borne jointly, according to the price of the original appraisal and that of
 the appraisal at the expiry of the lease.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 204/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1811
       It may not be stipulated:
       That the lessee shall bear the total loss of the livestock, although occurred through a fortuitous event and without
 his fault;
       Or that he shall bear in the loss a greater share than in the profits;
       Or that the lessor shall, at the end of the lease, set apart something more than the livestock which he has furnished.
       Any agreement of this kind is void.
       The lessee shall alone benefit from milk, manure and work of the animals leased.
       The wool and the increase in stock shall be divided.
 Art. 1812
       A lessee may not dispose of any animal of a herd or flock, either from the stock or from the increase, without the
 consent of the lessor who himself may not dispose of it without the consent of the lessee.
 Art. 1813
       Where livestock is given to the tenant of another, notice of it must be given to the landlord from whom that tenant
 holds; otherwise, he may seize it and have it sold for what his tenant owes him.
 Art. 1814
       A lessee may not shear without the consent of the lessor.
 Art. 1815
       Where no time has been fixed by the agreement for the duration of a lease, it is deemed made for three years.
 Art. 1816
       The lessor may claim its termination sooner, where the lessee does not fulfil his obligations.
 Art. 1817
 (Act of 9 June 1941)
       At the end of the lease or at the time of its termination, the lessor shall set apart animals of each kind in order to
 obtain a stock of cattle similar to that which he delivered, in particular as to number, breed, age, weight and quality of the
 animals; the excess shall be partitioned.
       Where there are not enough animals to replenish the stock of cattle such as defined above, the parties shall
 account to each other for the loss on the basis of the value of the animals on the day when the contract comes to an
 end.
       Any agreement under which, at the end of the lease or at the time of its termination, the lessee shall leave a stock of
 cattle of a value equal to the price of the appraisal of the one which he received, is void.
                        SECTION III

 in common for profits or for loss.
 Art. 1819
       A lessee shall alone profit from milk, manure and works of the animals, as in an ordinary lease of livestock.
       A lessor shall be entitled only to one half of the wool and of the increase.
       Any agreement to the contrary is void, unless the lessor is the owner of the farm of which the lessee is farmer or
 sharecropper.
 Art. 1820
       All the other rules of an ordinary lease of livestock shall apply to a lease of livestock by halves.
                        SECTION IV

 Art. 1821
 (Act of 9 June 1941)
 Articles 1821 to 1830
 Articles 1821 to 1826
       Such lease (also called iron lease of livestock) is one by which the owner of an agricultural holding gives it on lease
 on condition that at the expiry of the lease, the farmer shall leave the same stock of cattle as that which he received.
 Art. 1822
 (Act of 9 June 1941)
       The statement of the number, description and appraisal of the animals delivered, which appears in the lease, does
 not transfer ownership of them to the lessee. It has no other purpose than to be used as basis for the settlement to occur
 on the day when the contract comes to an end.
 Art. 1823
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 205/268
CIVIL CODE
       All profits belong to the farmer during the period of his lease, unless otherwise agreed.
 Art. 1824
       In leases of livestock leased to a farmer, the manure is not among the personal profits of the lessees, but belongs to
 the farm, for the cultivation of which it must be exclusively used.
 Art. 1825
 (Act of 5 Oct. 1941)
       Loss, even total and by fortuitous event, falls wholly upon the farmer, unless otherwise agreed.

       At the end of the lease or at the time of its termination, the lessee shall leave animals of each kind composing a
 stock of cattle similar to that which he received, in particular as to number, breed, age, weight and quality of the animals.
       Where there is an excess, it belongs to him.
       Where there is a deficit, settlement between the parties shall be made on the basis of the value of the animals on
 the day when the contract comes to an end.
       Any agreement under which, at the end of the lease or at the time of its termination, the lessee shall leave a stock of
 cattle of a value equal to the price of the appraisal of the one which he received, is void.
                                Paragraph 2
                                Of Livestock Leased to a Sharecropper

        TITLE VIII bis
        OF THE CONTRACT OF REAL ESTATE PROMOTION
 Art. 1831-1
 Articles 1831-1 to
 1831-5
       A contract of real estate promotion is an agency for the joint interest of both parties by which a person said"real
 estate promoter” binds himself towards a building owner to have the carrying out of a program of construction of one or
 several buildings undertaken for an agreed price and by way of contracts of hiring of services, as well as to undertake
 himself or have undertaken, for an agreed remuneration, all or part of the legal, administrative and financial formalities or
 transactions concurring for the same purpose. That promoter is the warrantor of the performance of the obligations
 placed on the persons with whom he has dealt on behalf of the building owner. “He is in particular responsible for the
 obligations resulting from Articles 1792, 1792-1, 1792-2 and 1792-3 of this Code” (Act no 78-12 of 4 Jan. 1978).
       Where a promoter binds himself to perform personnaly part of the operations of the program, he is bound, as to
 those operations, for the obligations of a hirer out of works.
 Art. 1831-2
       As to the promoter, the contract involves authority to conclude contracts, approve the works, close agreements and
 generally, do in the name of the building owner, all the transactions required by the carrying out of the program, up to
 the amount of the lump-sum agreed.
       However, a promoter binds the building owner, by the loans he contracts or the acts of disposal he enters into, only
 under a special agency contained in the contract or in a subsequent instrument.
       The building owner is bound to perform the undertakings contracted on his behalf by the promoter within the
 authority which the latter holds under a statute or the agreement.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 206/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1831-3
       Where, before the completion of the program, the building owner assigns the rights he has on it, the assignee is
 substituted to him by operation of law, as to assets and liabilities, for the whole of the contract. “The assignor is
 warrantor of the performance of the obligations placed on the building owner by the contract assigned” (Act no 72-649 of
 11 July 1972).
       Special agencies given to the promoter continue between the latter and the assignee.
       The promoter may not substitute a third party for himself in the performance of the obligations which he has
 contracted with the building owner without the consent of the latter.
       A contract of real estate promotion is effective against third parties only from the date of its entry on the land
 register.
 Art. 1831-4
       The task of a promoter comes to an end with the delivery of the work only where the accounts for construction have
 been definitely settled between the building owner and the promoter, all of which without prejudicing the actions for
 damages which may belong to the building owner against the promoter.
 Art. 1831-5
       Judicial arrangement or liquidation does not involve as of right the termination of a contract of real estate promotion.
 Any stipulation to the contrary shall be deemed not written.
        TITLE IX
        OF FIRMS AND COMPANIES
                CHAPTER I
                General Provisions

 Articles 1832 to 1873
 Articles 1832 to
 1844-17
       A firm is established by two or several persons which agree by a contract to appropriate property or their industry for
 a common venture with a view to sharing the benefit or profiting from the saving which may result therefrom.
       It may be established, in the cases provided for by statute, through an act of will of one person alone.
       The members bind themselves to contribute to losses.
 Art. 1832-1
       “Even where they use only community property for the contributions to a firm or for the acquisition of shares of a
 firm, two spouses alone or with other persons may be members of a same firm and participate together or not in the
 management of the firm” (Act no 82-596 of 10 July 1982).
       The advantages and gratuitous transfers resulting from a firm agreement between spouses may not be avoided
 because they would constitute disguised gifts, where their terms have been regulated by an authentic instrument.
 Art. 1832-2
 (Act no 82-596 of 10 July 1982)
       One spouse may not, under the penalty provided for in Article 1427, make use of community property in order to
 make a contribution to a firm or acquire non-negotiable shares of a firm without the other spouse being informed thereof
 and proof of it being adduced in the instrument.
       The capacity of member is acknowledged to the spouse who makes the contribution or the acquisition.
       The capacity of member is also acknowledged, for half of the shares subscribed or acquired, to the spouse who
 gave notice to the firm of his or her intention to be personally a member. Where he or she gives notice of his or her
 intention at the time of the contribution or acquisition, the acceptance or agreement of the members is effective as to
 both spouses. Where the notice is after the contribution or acquisition, the clauses requiring approval provided for this
 purpose in the articles of association or of partnership are available as against the spouse; at the time of the resolution
 on approval, the member spouse does not participate in the vote and his or her shares are not taken into account in
 calculating the quorum and the majority.
       The provisions of this Article shall apply only to firms whose shares are not negotiable and only until dissolution of
 the community.
 Art. 1833
       Every firm must have lawful objects and be formed in the common interest of the members.
 Art. 1834
       The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to all firms and companies, unless otherwise provided for by statute by
 reason of their form or of their objects.
 Art. 1835

 determine, in addition to the contributions of each member, the form, the objects, the name, the registered place of
 business, the capital of the firm, the duration of the firm and its rules of functioning.
 Art. 1836
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 207/268
CIVIL CODE
       Unless otherwise stipulated, the memorandum and the articles may be amended only by unanimous agreement of
 the members.
       In no case may the commitments of a member be increased without his consent.
 Art. 1837
       Every firm whose registered place of business is located on the French territory is subject to the provisions of
 French law.
       Third parties may avail themselves of the registered place of business determined in the articles, but the latter is not
 available as against them where the actual place of business is located elsewhere.
 Art. 1838
       The duration of a firm may not exceed ninety-nine years.
 Art. 1839
       Where the memorandum and the articles do not contain all the statements required by legislation or where a
 formality prescribed by it for the formation of a firm was omitted or irregularly completed, any person concerned may
 apply to the court for having the regularization of the formation ordered, by the imposition of a periodic penalty payment.
 The Government procurator’s office is entitled to sue for the same purposes.
       The same rules shall apply in case of amendment of the memorandum and of the articles.
       The action for purposes of regularization provided for in paragraph 1 is time-barred after three years from the
 registration of the firm or from the recording of the instrument amending the memorandum or the articles.
 Art. 1840
       The promoters, as well as the first members of the management, direction and administrative organs, are jointly and
 severally liable for the loss caused either by the want of a compulsory statement in the memorandum or the articles, or
 by the omission or irregular completion of a formality prescribed for the formation of the firm.
       In case of amendment of the memorandum or of the articles, the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall apply
 to the members of the management, direction and administrative organs then in office.
       The action is time-barred after ten years from the day when one or the other, according to the circumstances, of the
 formalities provided for in Article 1839, paragraph 3, has been completed.
 Art. 1841
       Firms which have not been thereto authorized by statute are prohibited to make public offerings or to issue
 negotiable securities, on pain of invalidity of the contracts concluded or of the securities issued.
 Art. 1842

 registration.
       Until registration the relations between members are governed by the firm agreement and by the general principles
 of law which apply to contracts and obligations.
 Art. 1843
       Persons who have acted on behalf of a firm in the making before registration are liable for the obligations arising
 from the acts so performed, jointly and severally where the firm is a merchant, jointly in the other cases. A firm regularly
 registered may take upon itself the undertakings entered into, which are then deemed to have been contracted by it as
 from the outset.
 Art. 1843-1
       A contribution of property or of a right subject to registration in order to be effective as against third parties may be
 registered before the registration of the firm and on condition that the latter takes place. From the latter, the effects of the
 formality retroact to the date of its fulfilment.
 Art. 1843-2
       The rights of each member in the capital of the firm are in proportion to his contribution at the time of the formation
 of the firm or in the course of its existence.
       (Act no 82-596 of 10 July 1982) Contributions in industry do not take part in the formation of the capital of the firm
 but give rise to an assigning of shares which entitles to the partition of profits and net assets, on condition that the losses
 are contributed to.
 Art. 1843-3
       Each member is debtor towards the firm for all that he has promised to contribute to it in kind, in money or in
 industry.
       Contributions in kind shall be executed by transfer of the corresponding rights and by the actual availability of the
 property.
       Where a contribution relates to ownership, the contributor is warrantor towards the firm in the same way as a seller
 towards his buyer.
       Where it relates to enjoyment, the contributor is warrantor towards the firm in the same way as a lessor towards his
 lessee. However, where a contribution relating to enjoyment concerns generic things or any other property bound to be
 renewed during the duration of the firm, the contract transfers to the latter the ownership of the property contributed, on
 condition that he returns a same quantity, quality and value thereof; in that case, the contributor is warrantor in the way

CIVIL CODE
 provided for in the preceding paragraph.
       The member who was to contribute a sum to the firm and has not done so, becomes by operation of law and
 without notice, debtor for interests on that sum from the day when it should have been paid and without prejudice to
 greater damages, if there is occasion. “Furthermore, where calls for funds in order to pay up the full amount of capital
 have not been made within a statutory period, any person concerned may apply to the president of the court who shall
 decide by way of interim relief proceedings either to order the administrators, directors and managers to carry out those
 calls for funds by imposing a periodic penalty payment, or to appoint an agent in charge of carrying out that formality”
 (Act no 2001-420 of 15 May 2001).
       The member who has bound himself to contribute his industry to the firm shall account to it for all the profits which
 he has gained through the activity which is the subject matter of his contribution.
 Art. 1843-4
       In all cases considering the assignment of a member’s rights in the firm, or the redemption of those rights by the
 firm, the value of those rights shall be determined, in case of dispute, by an expert appointed, either by the parties, or
 failing an agreement between them, by order of the president of the court who shall decide by way of interim relief
 proceedings and whose  judgment shall be final.
 Art. 1843-5
 (Act no 88-15 of 5 Jan. 1988)
       In addition to an action for compensation for the loss personally suffered, one or several members may institute an
 action on behalf of the firm against the directors. The claimants are entitled to seek compensation for the loss suffered
 by the firm; in case of award, the damages shall be allocated to the firm.
       Shall be deemed not written any clause of the memorandum or of the articles leading to subordinate the bringing of
 an action on behalf of a firm to a preliminary opinion or to the authorization of the meeting of the members or which
 would imply anticipated waiver of the bringing of that action.
       No decision of a meeting of members may lead to extinguish an action for compensation against the directors for
 fault committed in the fulfilment of their duties.
 Art. 1844
       Every member has the right to participate in collective decisions.
       The co-owners of an undivided share of the capital shall be represented by a single proxy, chosen among the
 undivided owners or outside. In case of disagreement, the proxy shall be designated in court, at the suit of the first
 requesting party.
       Where a share is burdened with a usufruct, the right to vote belongs to the bare-owner, except for decisions relating
 to the allocation of profits, in which case it is reserved for the usufructuary.
       The memorandum or the articles may derogate from the two preceding paragraphs.
 Art. 1844-1
       Unless otherwise agreed, the share of each member in the profits and his contribution to losses are determined in
 proportion to his hare in the capital of the firm and the share of a member who has contributed only his industry is equal
 to that of the member who has contributed the least.
       However, a stipulation by which a member is allotted the whole of the profit gained by the firm, or is released for the
 whole of the losses, the one by which a member is excluded in whole from the profit or is liable for the whole of the
 losses shall be deemed not written.
 Art. 1844-2
 (Act no 78-753 of 17 July 1978)
       A mortgage or any other security in rem on property of the firm may be given by virtue of powers resulting from
 resolutions or delegations established under private signatures, although the mortgage or of the security must be
 granted by an authentic instrument.
 Art. 1844-3
       The proper transformation of a firm into a firm of another type does not involve the creation of a new juridical
 person. It shall be the same as to extension of duration or any other amendment of the memorandum or articles.
 Art. 1844-4
       A firm, even in liquidation, may be absorbed by another firm or participate in the formation of a new firm, by way of
 merger.
       It may also transfer its patrimony by way of split-off to existing or new firms.
       Those dealings may occur between firms of different types.
       They shall be decided, by each firm concerned, in the way provided for as to amendment of the memorandum or
 articles.
       Where the dealing involves the creation of new firms, each of them shall be formed in accordance with the rules
 appropriate to the type of firm adopted.
 Art. 1844-5
       “The reuniting of all the shares of the capital into a single hand does not involve the dissolution of the firm by
 operation of law. Any person concerned may apply for that dissolution where the situation has not been regularized
 within the period of one year. The court may grant the firm a maximum period of six months to regularize the situation. It
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 209/268
CIVIL CODE
 may not rule for dissolution where, on the day when it decides, that regularization has occurred” (Act no 81-1161 of 30
 Dec. 1981).
       The fact that the usufruct of all the shares of capital belongs to the same person has no consequence as to the
 existence of the firm.
       “In case of dissolution, it involves the universal transfer of the patrimony of the firm to the sole member, without
 there being occasion for liquidation. The creditors may object to the dissolution within a period of thirty days after the
 recording of the latter. A judicial decision shall dismiss the objection or order either the payment of the claims, or the
 constitution of warranties where the firm offers any and where they are considered sufficient. The transfer of the
 patrimony is carried out and the juridical person vanishes only at the end of the period for objection or, if there is
 occasion, where the objection has been dismissed in first instance or where the payment of the claims has been made
 or the warranties constituted” (Act no 88-15 of 5 Jan. 1988)
       “The provisions of paragraph 3 shall not apply to firms whose sole member is a natural person” (Act no 2001-420 of
 15 May 2001).
 Art. 1844-6
       An extension of the duration of a firm must be decided by a unanimous vote of the members, or, where the
 memorandum or articles so provide, by the majority required for their amendment.
       One year at least before the date of the expiry of the firm, the opinion of the members must be taken for the purpose
 of deciding whether the duration of the firm must be extended.
       Failing which, any member may apply to the president of the court ruling by interim ex parte order, for the
 appointment of a judicial agent in charge of instituting the consultation provided for above.
 Art. 1844-7
       A firm comes to an end:
       1° By the expiry of the time for which it was formed, except for an extension of duration decided in accordance with
 Article 1844-6;
       2° By the achievement or the extinction of its objects;
       3° By annulment of the firm agreement;
       4° By anticipated dissolution decided by the members;
       5° By anticipated dissolution ordered by the court on application of a member for just reasons, notably in case of
 non-performance of his obligations by a member, or of disagreement between members which paralyses the running of
 the firm;
       6° By anticipated dissolution ordered by the court in the case provided for in Article 1844-5;
       7° “By the effect of a judgment ordering the winding-up [...]" (Act no 88-15 of 5 Jan. 1988);
       8° For any other reason specified in the memorandum or articles.
 Art. 1844-8
       The dissolution of a firm involves its liquidation, except for the cases provided for by Article 1844-4 “and by Article
 1844-5, paragraph 3” (Act no 88-15 of 5 Jan. 1988). It is effective against third persons only after it has been recorded.
       A liquidator shall be appointed in accordance with the provisions of the memorandum or of the articles. Where they
 are silent, he shall be appointed by the members or, where the latter were unable to make that appointment, by order of
 the court. A liquidator may be dismissed in the same manner. The appointment and the dismissal are effective against
 third persons only after they have been recorded. Neither the firm nor third persons may, in order to elude their
 undertakings, avail themselves of an irregularity in the appointment or dismissal of a liquidator, where the latter has
 been duly recorded.
       The juridical personality of a firm still exists for the needs of liquidation until recording of its closing.
       Where the closing of a liquidation has not happened within three years after the dissolution, the Government
 procurator’s office or any person concerned may refer the matter to the court which shall have the liquidation instituted
 or completed, where it has begun.
 Art. 1844-9
       After paying the debts and reimbursing the capital of the firm, the partition of the assets shall be made among the
 members in the same proportion as their participation in the profits, except for clause or agreement to the contrary.
       The rules relating to the partition of successions, including preferential allotment, shall apply to partitions between
 members of a firm or company.
       However, the members may lawfully decide, either in the memorandum or articles, or by a separate resolution or
 instrument, that certain property shall be allotted to certain members. Failing which, any property contributed which is
 found in kind in the assets to be partitioned shall be allotted, on his request and on condition of adjustment, if there is
 occasion, to the member who had contributed it. That faculty shall be exercised before any other right to a preferential
 allotment.
       All members, or some of them only, may also remain in undivided ownership of all or part of the property of the firm.
 Their relationships as to that property shall be then regulated, at the close of the liquidation, by the provisions relating to
 undivided ownership.
 Art. 1844-10
       Annulment of a firm may result only from the infringement of the provisions of Articles 1832, 1832-1, paragraph 1,
 and 1833 or from one of the grounds for annulment of contracts in general.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 210/268
CIVIL CODE
       Any clause of the memorandum or of the articles contrary to a mandatory provision of this Title, the sanction of
 whose infringement is not annulment of the firm, shall be deemed not written.
       Annulment of transactions or resolutions of the organs of a firm may result only from the infringement of a
 mandatory provision of this Title or from one of the grounds for annulment of contracts in general.
 Art. 1844-11
       An action for annulment is extinguished where the ground for annulment has ceased to exist on the day when the
 court rules on the merits in first instance, unless that annulment is based on the wrongfulness of the objects of the firm.
 Art. 1844-12
       In case of annulment of a firm or of transactions or resolutions subsequent to its formation, based on a defect in
 consent or on the disability of a member, and where regularization may take place, any person having an interest therein
 may put on notice the person who is able of doing so, either to regularize, or to sue for annulment within a period of six
 months on pain of being time-barred. The firm shall be informed of that putting on notice.
       The firm or a member may submit to the court seized within the period provided for in the preceding paragraph, any
 measure appropriate to clear away the interest of the plaintiff, particularly through the redemption of his rights in the firm.
 In that case the court may, either rule for annulment or make compulsory the proposed measure where they have been
 previously adopted by the firm in the conditions provided for the amendments of the memorandum or of the articles. The
 vote of the member whose redemption of the rights is applied for is of no effect on the decisions of the firm.
       In case of dispute, the value of the rights in the firm to redeem from a member shall be determined in accordance
 with the provisions of Article 1843-4.
 Art. 1844-13
       A court to which an action for annulment has been referred, may, even of its own motion, fix a period to allow for the
 remedy of the invalidities. It may not order annulment less than two months after the date of the originating process.
       Where, in order to remedy an invalidity, a meeting must be convened, or a consultation of the members take place,
 and where proof is given of a proper notice convening that meeting or of the sending to the members of the text of the
 proposed resolutions with the documents which must be communicated to them, the court shall grant by judgment the
 period necessary for the members to come to a decision.
 Art. 1844-14
       The actions for annulment of a firm or of transactions or resolutions subsequent to its formation are time-barred
 after three years from the day when annulment was incurred.
 Art. 1844-15
       Where annulment of a firm is ordered, it puts an end, without retroactivity, to the performance of the contract.
       As regards the juridical person which may have come into being, it produces the effects of a judicially ordered
 dissolution.
 Art. 1844-16
       Neither the firm nor the members may avail themselves of an annulment with regard to third parties in good faith.
 However, annulment resulting from a disability or from one of the defects in consent is available even against third
 parties by the person under a disability and his statutory representatives, or by the member whose consent was abused
 by error, deception or duress.
 Art. 1844-17
       An action for compensation based on the annulment of the firm or of transactions and resolutions subsequent to the
 formation is time-barred after three years from the day when the judgment of annulment has become res judicata.
       The vanishing of the ground for annulment is not a bar to the bringing of an action for damages for the purpose of
 compensating the loss caused by the defect by which the firm, the transaction or the resolution was vitiated. That action
 is time-barred after three years from the day when the invalidity was remedied.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Partnership for Non-Commercial Purposes
                        SECTION I
                        General Provisions
 Art. 1845
 Articles 1845 to 1870-1
 Articles 1845 to 1845-1
       The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to all firms for non-commercial purposes, unless they are derogated from
 by the particular statutory status to which some of them are subject.
       Have non-commercial character all firms to which legislations does not attribute another character by reason of their
 form, nature or objects.
 Art. 1845-1
       The capital of a partnership shall be divided into equal shares.
       (Act no 2001-1168 of 11 Dec. 2001) The provisions of Chapter I of Title III of Book II of the Commercial Code
 relating to the variable capital of companies shall apply to partnerships for non-commercial purposes.
                        SECTION II
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 211/268
CIVIL CODE
                        Of Management
 Articles 1846 to 1851
 Art. 1846
       A partnership shall be managed by one or several persons, partners or not, appointed either by the articles of
 partnership, or by a special act, or by a resolution of the partners.
       The articles shall fix the rules for the designation of the manager or managers and the method of organization of the
 management.
       Unless otherwise provided in the articles, a manager shall be appointed by a resolution of the partners representing
 more than half of the shares of the partnership.
       Where the articles are silent, and where the partners have not decided otherwise at the time of the appointment, the
 managers shall be deemed appointed for the duration of the partnership.
       Where, for whatever reason, a partnership is deprived of a manager, any partner may apply to the president of the
 court deciding by interim relief order for the designation of a judicial agent in charge of convening a meeting of the
 partners for the purpose of appointing one or several managers.
 Art. 1846-1
       Apart from the cases referred to in Article 1844-7, a partnership comes to an end through anticipated dissolution
 which a court may order on application of any person concerned, where it has been devoid of manager for more than
 one year.
 Art. 1846-2
       The appointment and cessation of duties of the managers must be recorded.
       Neither a partnership nor third parties may avail themselves of an irregularity in the appointment of managers or in
 the cessation of their duties in order to elude their undertakings, where those decisions have been duly recorded.
 Art. 1847
       Where a juridical person carries on the management, its managers are subject to the same conditions and
 obligations and incur the same civil and penal liabilities as though they were managers on their own behalf, without
 prejudice to the joint and several liability of the juridical person which they direct.
 Art. 1848
       In the relationships between partners, a manager may do all the acts of management which the interest of the
 partnership requires.
       Where there are several managers, they exercise those powers separately, except for the right which belongs to
 each of them to object to a transaction before it is concluded.
       All of which failing a special provision in the articles on the method of administration.
 Art. 1849
       In the relationships with third parties, a manager binds the partnership through transactions which fall under the
 objects of the partnership.
       In case of plurality of managers, they possess separately the powers provided for in the preceding paragraph. An
 objection made by one manager to the transactions of another manager is of no effect with regard to third parties, unless
 it is proved that they have had knowledge of it.
       Clauses of the articles limiting the powers of the managers may not be invoked against third parties.
 Art. 1850
       Each manager is liable individually towards the partnership and towards third parties, either for violations of statutes
 and regulations, or for an infringement of the articles, or for faults committed in his management.
       Where several managers have participated in the same acts, their liability is joint and several towards third parties
 and partners.
       However, in their relationships between them, the court shall determine the contributory share of each in the
 compensation for the loss.
 Art. 1851
       Unless the articles provide otherwise, a manager may be dismissed by a resolution of the partners representing
 more than half of the shares of the partnership. Where a dismissal is decided without just reason, it may give rise to
 damages
       A manager may also be dismissed by the courts for a legitimate cause, on application of any partner.
       Unless otherwise provided, the dismissal of a manager, whether he is a partner or not, does not involve dissolution
 of the partnership. Where the dismissed manager is a partner, he may, unless the articles provide otherwise, or the
 other partners decide anticipated dissolution of the partnership, withdraw from it in the way provided for in Article 1869,
 paragraph 2.
                        SECTION III
                        Of Collective Resolutions
 Art. 1852
 Articles 1852 to 1854
       Resolutions which exceed the powers conferred upon managers shall be passed according to the provisions of the
 articles or, failing such provisions, by the partners unanimously.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 212/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1853
       Resolutions shall be passed by the partners convened in a meeting. The articles may also provide that they will
 result from a written consultation.
 Art. 1854
       Resolutions may also result from the consent of all the partners expressed in an instrument.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Notice to Partners
 Art. 1855
 Articles 1855 to 1856
       The partners are entitled to obtain, at least once a year, notice of the books and documents of the partnership, and
 to ask questions in writing on the management of the partnership, to which a reply must be made in writing within the
 period of one month.
 Art. 1856
       The managers must, at least once in the year, account for their management to the partners. That statement of
 accounts must include a comprehensive written report on the activity of the partnership during the year or the accounting
 period elapsed including a statement of the profits realized or foreseeable and of the losses incurred or foreseen.
                        SECTION V
                        Of the Liability of Partners with regard to Third Parties
 Art. 1857
 Articles 1857 to 1860
       With regard to third parties, partners are liable indefinitely for debts of the partnership in proportion to their share in
 the capital of the partnership on the date when falling due or on the day of cessation of payments.
       A partner who has contributed only his industry is liable like the one whose contribution in the capital is the smallest.
 Art. 1858
       Creditors may sue a partner for payment of the debts of the partnership only after suing first and vainly the juridical
 person.
 Art. 1859
       All actions against partners who are not liquidators or their heirs and assigns are time-barred after five years from
 the time when the dissolution of the partnership has been recorded.
 Art. 1860
       Where there is insolvency, personal bankruptcy, judicial liquidation or judicial arrangement befalling a partner,
 unless the others unanimously decide to dissolve the partnership by anticipation or that dissolution is provided for by the
 articles, reimbursement shall be made, subject to the conditions set out in Article 1843-4, of the rights in the partnership
 of the party concerned, who then loses the status of partner.
                        SECTION VI
                        Of the Transfer of Shares of the Capital
 Art. 1861
       Shares of the capital may be transferred only with the approval of all the partners.
 Articles 1861 to 1868
       The articles may however agree that the approval will be obtained by a majority which they fix, or that it may be
 granted by the managers. They may also dispense from approval the transfers made to partners or to the spouse of one
 of them. Unless otherwise provided by the articles, transfers made to ascendants or descendants of the transferor are
 not subject to approval.
       Notice shall be given of the planned transfer, with request for approval, to the partnership and to each one of the
 partners. Notice shall be given only to the partnership where the articles provide that the approval may be granted by the
 managers.
       Where two spouses are simultaneously members of one partnership, the transfers made by one of them to the other
 must, in order to be valid, result from a notarial instrument or from an instrument under private signature having acquired
 an undisputable date otherwise than by the death of the transferor.
 Art. 1862
       Where several partners express their wish to acquire, they are, unless there is a clause or an agreement to the
 contrary, deemed purchasers in proportion to the number of shares which they held previously.
       Where no partner stands as purchaser, the partnership may have the shares acquired by a third person designated
 by the other partners unanimously or according to the methods provided for by the articles. The partnership may also
 initiate the redemption of the shares for the purpose of cancelling them.
       The transferor shall be given notice of the names of the proposed purchaser or purchasers, partners or third
 persons, or of the offer of redemption by the partnership, as well as of the price offered. In case of dispute on the price,
 the latter shall be fixed in accordance with the provisions of Article 1843-4, the whole without prejudice to the right of the
 transferor to keep his shares.
 Art. 1863
       Where no offer of redemption is made to the transferor within a period of six months after the last of the notifications
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 213/268
CIVIL CODE
 provided for in Article 1861, paragraph 3, approval of the transfer shall be deemed granted, unless the other partners
 decide, within the same period, the anticipated dissolution of the partnership.
       In the latter case, the transferor may cause that decision to lapse by making it known that he waives the transfer
 within a period of one month after the said decision.
 Art. 1864
       The provisions of the two preceding Articles may be derogated from only in order to modify the period of six months
 stared in Article 1863, paragraph 1, and provided the period stated in the articles be not  over one year or below one
 month.
 Art. 1865
       A transfer of shares of capital must be drawn up in writing. It shall be made invokable against the partnership under
 the forms provided for in Article 1690 or, where the articles so stipulate, by transfer on the registers of the partnership.
       It may be invoked against third persons only after completion of those formalities and after recording.
 Art. 1866
       Shares of the capital may be the subject of a pledge attested, either by an authentic instrument, or by an instrument
 under private signature served upon the partnership or accepted by it in an authentic instrument and giving rise to a
 recording whose date determines the rank of the pledgee creditors. Those whose instruments are recorded on the same
 day rank equally.
       The prior charge of a pledgee creditor stands on the pledged rights on the capital through the sole fact of recording 
the pledge.
 Art. 1867
       Any partner may obtain from the other partners their approval of a plan of pledge under the same conditions as their
 approval of a transfer of shares.
       A consent given to a plan of pledge involves approval of the transferee in case of forced sale of the shares of capital
 on condition that notice of the sale be given to the partners and the partnership at least one month before the sale.
       Each partner may substitute himself for the purchaser within a period of five clear days from the sale. Where several
 partners exercise that faculty, they shall be, unless there is a clause or an agreement to the contrary, deemed
 purchasers in proportion to the number of shares which they held previously. Where no partner exercises that faculty,
 the partnership may redeem the shares itself, for the purpose of cancelling them.
 Art. 1868
       Notice must be given likewise of a forced sale which does not result from a pledge to which the other partners have
 given their approval, one month before the sale to the partners or to the partnership.
       The partners may, within that period, decide to dissolve the partnership or to acquire the shares in the way provided
 for in Articles 1862 and 1863.
       Where a sale has taken place, the partners or the partnership may exercise the faculty of substitution which is theirs
 under Article 1867. The non-exercise of that faculty involves approval of the purchaser.
                        SECTION VII
                        Of the Withdrawal or Death of a Partner
 Art. 1869
 Articles 1869 to 1870-1
       Without prejudice to the rights of third persons, a partner may withdraw totally or partially from the partnership,
 subject to the conditions laid down in the articles or, failing which, after authorization given by a unanimous resolution of
 the other partners. That withdrawal may also be authorized by a judicial decision for just reasons.
       Unless Article 1844-9, paragraph 3, applies, the partner who withdraws is entitled to reimbursement of the value of
 his rights in the partnership, fixed in accordance with Article 1843-4, failing an amicable agreement.
 Art. 1870
       A partnership is not dissolved by the death of a partner, but continues with his heirs or legatees, unless the articles
 provide that they must be approved of by the partners.
       It may however be agreed that the death will involve dissolution of the partnership or that it will continue with only
 the surviving partners.
       It may also be agreed that the partnership will continue either with the surviving spouse, or with one or several of
 the heirs, or with any other person designated by the articles or where the latter so authorize, by a testamentary
 disposition.
       Unless the articles provide otherwise, where the succession devolves upon a juridical person, the latter may
 become a partner only with the approval of the other partners, granted under the conditions provided for by the articles,
 or failing which, by unanimous agreement of the partners.
 Art. 1870-1
       Heirs or legatees who do not become partner are entitled only to the value of the shares in the capital of their
 predecessor in title. That value must be paid to them by the new holders of the shares or by the partnership itself where
 it has redeemed them for the purpose of cancelling them.
       The value of these shares in the capital shall be determined on the day of death in the conditions provided for in
 Article 1843-4.

Articles 1871 to 1873
 CIVIL CODE
                CHAPTER III
                Of Undisclosed Partnership
 Art. 1871
       Partners may agree that the partnership will not be registered. The partnership is then called “undisclosed
 partnership”. It is not a juridical person and is not subject to registration.
       The partners freely agree upon the objects, operation and methods of the undisclosed partnership, provided that the
 mandatory provisions of Articles 1832, 1832-1, 1833, 1836, paragraph 2, 1841, 1844, paragraph 1 and 1844-1,
 paragraph 2, be not derogated from.
 Art. 1871-1
       Unless a different organization has been provided for, the relationships between partners are governed, as may be
 thought proper, either by the provisions which apply to partnerships for non-commercial purposes, where the firm is of a
 non-commercial character, or, where it is of a commercial character, by those which apply to partnerships for
 commercial purposes. 
Art. 1872
       With regard to third parties, each partner remains owner of the property which he placed at the disposal of the
 partnership. 
       Shall be deemed undivided between the partners the property acquired by investment or re-investment of undivided
 funds during the partnership and that which was undivided before being placed at the disposal of the partnership. 
       It shall be likewise for that which the partners have agreed  to place in undivided ownership.
       It may furthermore be agreed that one of the partners is, with regard to the others, owner of all or part of the
 property which he acquires with a view to the carrying out of the objects of the partnership.
 Art. 1872-1
       Each partner contracts in his own name and is alone bound with regard to third parties.
       However, where the undisclosed partners act as partners to third parties’ knowledge, each one of them is bound
 with regard to the latter for the obligations arising from acts performed in that capacity by one of the others, jointly and
 severally where the partnership is a merchant, jointly, in the other cases.
       It shall be the same as to a partner who, through his interference, has led the contracting party to believe that he
 intended to bind himself towards him or of whom it is proved that the undertaking has turned to his benefit.
       In all cases, as to property deemed undivided under Article 1872, paragraph 2 and 3, shall apply in the relationships
 with third parties, either the provisions of Chapter VI of Title I of Book III of this Code, or, where the formalities provided
 for in Article 1873-2 have been completed, those of Title IX bis of this Book, all the partners being then, unless otherwise
 agreed, deemed managers of the undivided ownership.
 Art. 1872-2
       Where an undisclosed partnership is of indefinite duration, its dissolution may result at any time from a notice
 served by one of them on all the partners, provided that the notice be in good faith and not made inopportunely.
       Unless otherwise agreed, no partner may request partition of the undivided property under Article 1872 so long as
 the partnership is not dissolved.
 Art. 1873
       The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to de facto partnerships.
        TITLE IX bis
        OF AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE EXERCISE OF UNDIVIDED RIGHTS
 Art. 1873-1
 Articles 1873-2 to
 1873-1
       The persons having rights to be exercised on undivided property, as owners, bare owners or usufructuaries may
 enter into agreements relating to the exercise of those rights.
                CHAPTER I
                Of Agreements relating to the Exercise of Undivided Rights in the Absence of a
 Usufructuary
 Art. 1873-2
 Articles 1873-2 to
 815-17 shall apply t
       Where they all consent thereto, undivided co-owners may agree to remain in undivided ownership.
       On pain of annulment, the agreement must be drawn up in an instrument including the description of the undivided
 property and indication of the shares belonging to each undivided owner. Where the undivided property includes claims,
 the formalities of Article 1690 shall take place; where it includes immovables, the formalities of land registration shall
 take place.
 Art. 1873-3
       The agreement may be concluded for a determined duration which may not exceed five years. It may be renewed
 by an express decision of the parties. A partition may be instigated before the agreed term only where there are proper
 reasons for it.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 215/268
CIVIL CODE
       The agreement may also be concluded for an indeterminate duration. In that case, a partition may be instigated at
 any time, provided it is not in bad faith or inopportune.
       It may be decided that an agreement for a determined duration will be renewed by tacit extension of the period, for a
 determined or indeterminate duration. Failing such agreement, the undivided ownership shall be governed by Articles
 815 and following at the expiry of the agreement for a determined duration.
 Art. 1873-4
       The capacity or power to dispose of the undivided property is required for an agreement  designed to maintain
 undivided ownership.
       The agreement may, however, be concluded on behalf of a minor, by his statutory representative alone; but in that
 case, the minor, become of age, may put an end to it, whatever its duration may be, within the year following his
 majority.
       [repealed]
 Art. 1873-5
       The undivided co-owners may appoint one or several managers, chosen from among themselves or not. The
 methods of appointing and dismissing a manager may be determined by a unanimous decision of the undivided owners.
       Failing such an agreement, a manager taken from among the undivided owners may be dismissed from his duties
 only by a unanimous decision of the other undivided owners.
       A manager who is not an undivided owner may be dismissed in the way agreed upon among his principals or, failing
 which, by a decision taken by a majority of the undivided owners as to number and shares.
       In all cases, dismissal may be ordered by the court on application of one undivided owner where the manager,
 through his mismanagement, imperils the interests of the undivided ownership.
       Where a dismissed manager is an undivided owner, the agreement shall be deemed concluded for an indeterminate
 duration from his dismissal. 
Art. 1873-6
       A manager represents the undivided owners within his authority, either for transactions of civil life, or in court as
 plaintiff or defendant. He shall give, in a merely declaratory way, the names of all the undivided owners in the first
 procedural document.
       A manager shall administer the undivided ownership and exercises for this purpose the powers “conferred on each
 spouse” (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985) on community property. He may, however, dispose of tangible movables only
 for the needs of a normal use of the undivided ownership, or also where things difficult to preserve or subject to decay
 are concerned. Any clause extending the authority of a manager shall be deemed not written.
 Art. 1873-7
       A manager shall exercise the authority given by the preceding Article even where there is a person under a
 disability among the undivided owners.
       Nevertheless, Article 456, paragraph 3, shall apply to leases granted in the course of an undivided ownership.
 Art. 1873-8
       Decisions which exceed the authority of a manager shall be passed unanimously, except for the manager, where he
 is himself an undivided owner, to avail himself of the remedies provided for by Articles 815-4, 815-5 and 815-6.
       Where there are minors or adults under a disability among the undivided owners, the decisions referred to in the
 preceding paragraph give rise to the application of the rules of protection provided for in their favour.
       It may be agreed between the undivided owners that in the absence of persons under a disability certain categories
 of decisions will be passed otherwise than unanimously. However, no undivided immovable may be transferred without
 the agreement of all the undivided owners unless it is under Articles 815-4 and 815-5 above.
 Art. 1873-9
       An agreement of undivided ownership may regulate the methods of administration in case of a plurality of
 managers. Failing special stipulations, the latter hold separately the authgority provided for by Article 1873-6, subject to
 the right of each to object to any transaction before it is concluded.
 Art. 1873-10
       Unless otherwise agreed, a manager is entitled to remuneration for his work. The terms of it shall be fixed by the
 undivided owners, to the exclusion of the party concerned, or, failing which, by the president of the tribunal de grande
 instance  who shall give a provisional ruling.
       A manager is liable as an agent for the faults he commits in his management.
 Art. 1873-11
       Each undivided owner may require notice of all documents relating to the management. A manager must, once a
 year, account for his management to the undivided owners. On that occasion, he shows in writing the profits made and
 the losses incurred or foreseeable.
       Each undivided owner is obliged to participate in the expenses for preservation of the undivided property. Failing a
 special agreement, Articles 815-9, 815-10 and 815-11 of this Code shall apply to the exercise of the right of use and
 enjoyment, as well as to the sharing of profits and losses.
 Art. 1873-12
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 216/268
CIVIL CODE
       In case of transfer of all or part of the rights of an undivided owner in the undivided property, or in one or several
 items of that property, the undivided co-owners enjoy the rights of pre-emption and substitution provided for by Articles
 815-14 to 815-16 and 815-18 of this Code.
       The agreement shall be deemed concluded for an indeterminate duration where, for any reason whatever, an
 undivided share devolves upon a person not belonging to the undivided ownership.
 Art. 1873-13
       The undivided owners may agree that upon the death of one of them, each survivor may acquire the share of the
 deceased or that the surviving spouse, or any other designated heir may have it allotted to him “on condition that he
 accounts for it to the succession according to its value at the time of the acquisition or of the allotment” (Act no 78-627 of
 10 June 1978).
       Where several undivided owners or several heirs simultaneously exercise their faculty of acquisition or allotment,
 they shall be deemed, unless otherwise agreed, to acquire together the share of the deceased in proportion to their
 respective rights in the undivided ownership or the succession.
       The provisions of this Article may not prejudice the application of the provisions of Articles 832 to 832-3.
 Art. 1873-14
       A faculty of acquisition or allotment lapses where its beneficiary has not exercised it through notice served on the
 surviving undivided owners or on the heirs of the predeceaser within the period of one month after the day when he has
 been given notice to come to a decision. That notice may not itself take place before the expiry of the period provided for
 in the Title Of Successions for making an inventory and deliberating.
       Where no faculty of acquisition or allotment has been provided for, or where it has lapsed, the share of the
 deceased falls to his heirs or legatees. In such case, the agreement of undivided ownership shall be deemed concluded
 for an indeterminate duration from the day of the opening of the succession.
 Art. 1873-15
       "815-17 shall apply to creditors of an undivided ownership, as well as to personal creditors of the undivided owners.
       However, the latter may instigate partition only in the cases where their debtor could himself instigate it. In the other
 cases, they may sue for seizure and sale of the share of their debtor in the undivided ownership by complying with the
 formalities provided for by the Code of Civil Procedure. The provisions of Article 1873-12 shall then apply. 
Art. 815-17 shall apply to creditors of an undivided ownership, as well as to personal creditors of the undivided owners.
       However, the latter may instigate partition only in the cases where their debtor could himself instigate it. In the other
 cases, they may sue for seizure and sale of the share of their debtor in the undivided ownership by complying with the
 formalities provided for by the Code of Civil Procedure. The provisions of Article 1873-12 shall then apply. 
                CHAPTER II
                Of Agreements relating to the Exercise of Undivided Rights in the Presence of a
 Usufructuary
 Art. 1873-16
 Articles 1873-16 to
 1873-18
       Where undivided property is burdened with a usufruct, agreements, subject as a rule to the provisions of the
 preceding Chapter, may be concluded, either between the bare owners, or between the usufructuaries, or between the
 ones and the others. There may also be an agreement between those who are in undivided ownership as to enjoyment
 and the one who is bare owner of the whole property, as well as between a universal usufructuary and the bare owners.
 Art. 1873-17
       Where the usufructuaries were not parties to the agreement, third parties who have dealt with the manager of an
 undivided ownership may not avail themselves of the powers which would have been granted to him by the bare owners
 to the prejudice of the rights of usufruct.
 Art. 1873-18
       Where an agreement concluded between usufructuaries and bare owners provides that decisions will be passed by
 a majority in number and in shares, the rights to vote attaching to shares is divided by halves between the usufruct and
 the bare ownership, unless the parties agreed otherwise.
       Any expense exceeding the obligations of a usufructuary, such as defined in Articles 582 and following, binds him
 only with his consent given in the agreement itself or through a later instrument.
       The transfer of full ownership of the undivided property may not be made without the consent of the usufructuary,
 except for the case where it is induced by the creditors entitled to sue for sale.
        TITLE X
        OF LOANS
 Art. 1874
       There are two kinds of loans:
       That of things which can be used without being destroyed,
       And that of things which are consumed by the use which is made of them.
       The first kind is called loan for use or commodate;
       The second is called loan for consumption , or simply loan.

 Art. 1875
 Articles 1875 to 1879
       A loan for use or commodate is a contract by which one of the parties delivers to the other a thing to be used, on
 condition that the borrower returns it after making use of it.
 Art. 1876
       Such loan is essentially gratuitous.
 Art. 1877
       The lender remains the owner of the thing loaned.
 Art. 1878
       Everything which may be the subject of legal transactions between private individuals, and which is not consumed
 by use may be the object of such an agreement.
 Art. 1879
       Undertakings which are formed by a commodate pass to the heirs of the person who lends, and to the heirs of the
 person who borrows;
       But where a loan was made only on account of the borrower, and to him personally, then his heirs may not continue
 to enjoy the thing loaned.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Undertakings of the Borrower
 Art. 1880
 Articles 1880 to 1887
       The borrower is bound to take care of the keeping and preservation of the thing loaned like a prudent owner. He
 may use it only for the use determined by its nature or by the agreement; all of which, on pain of damages, if there is
 occasion.
 Art. 1881
       Where the borrower employs the thing for another use, or for a longer time than he ought, he is liable for the loss
 occurred, even through a fortuitous event.
 Art. 1882
       Where the thing loaned perishes through a fortuitous event of which the borrower could have preserved it by making
 use of his own, or where, being able to save only one of them, he preferred his own, he is liable for the loss of the other.
 Art. 1883
       Where the thing has been appraised when loaned, the loss which happens, even through a fortuitous event, falls on
 the borrower, unless otherwise agreed.
 Art. 1884
       Where the thing deteriorates through the sole effect of the use for which it was borrowed, and without any fault on
 the part of the borrower, he is not liable for the deterioration.
 Art. 1885
       The borrower may not retain the thing to offset what the lender owes him.
 Art. 1886
       Where the borrower has made some expense in order to use the thing, he may not reclaim it.
 Art. 1887
       Where several persons have jointly borrowed the same thing, they are jointly and severally liable towards the
 lender.
                        SECTION III

 a pressing and unforeseen need of the thing, the judge may, according to the circumstances, compel the borrower to
 return it to him.

 extraordinary expense, necessary and so urgent that he was no able to inform the lender thereof, the latter is liable to
 reimburse him.
 Art. 1891
       Where the thing loaned has such defects that it may cause harm to the person who uses it, the lender is liable,
 where he knew of the defects and did not warn the borrower.

 which are consumed by use, on condition that the latter shall return as much to him in the same kind and quality.
 Art. 1893
       Through such a loan, the borrower becomes the owner of the thing loaned; and the loss falls upon him, in whatever
 manner it occurs.
 Art. 1894
       Things which, although of the same kind, differ individually, such as animals, may not be given by way of loan of
 consumption:  it is then a loan for use.
 Art. 1895
       The obligation which results from a loan of money is always for the numerical sum stated in the contract.
       Where there is a rise or a fall in currency before the time of payment, the debtor must return the numerical sum
 loaned, and must do so only in the currency having legal tender at the time of the payment.
 Art. 1896
       The rule laid down in the preceding Article shall not apply, where the loan was made in bullions.
 Art. 1897
       Where bullions or commodities have been loaned, whatever the rise or fall in their price may be, the debtor shall
 always return the same quantity and quality, and return only that.

       Where no time has been fixed for restitution, the judge may allow the borrower a period according to the
 circumstances.

       Where it has only been agreed that the borrower would pay when he could, or he had the means, the judge shall fix
 a time for the payment, according to the circumstances.

       Where he is unable to do so, he is bound to pay their value taking into account the time and the place where the
 thing was to be returned according to the agreement.
       Where those time and place have not been regulated, payment shall be made at the price of the time and the place
 where the loan was made.
 Art. 1904
 (Act of 7 April 1900)
       Where the borrower does not return the things loaned or their value at the agreed  time, he owes interest thereon

                Of Loans at Interest
 Art. 1905
       It is lawful to stipulate interest for a simple loan, either of money, or of commodities, or of other movable things.
 Art. 1906
       The borrower who has paid interest which was not stipulated may neither reclaim it, nor appropriate it to the capital.
 Art. 1907
       Interest is statutory or conventional. Statutory interest is fixed by statute1. Conventional interest may exceed 
statutory interest whenever a statute does not so prohibit2.
       The rate of conventional interest must be fixed in writing.

       2 Consumer Code Art. L. 313-1 to L. 313-3
 Art. 1908
       A receipt for capital given without reservations as to the interest gives rise to a presumption of payment of the latter
 and operates discharge of it.
 Art. 1909
       Interest may be stipulated upon a capital which the lender undertakes not to reclaim.
       In that case, the loan takes the name of settlement of an annuity.
 Art. 1910
       That annuity may be settled in two ways, perpetually or for life.
 Art. 1911
       A perpetual annuity is essentially redeemable.

 or without notification has been given to the creditor at the period of notice which they have determined.
 Art. 1912
       The debtor of an annuity settled as perpetual may be compelled to redeem it:
       1° Where he ceases to perform his obligations during two years;
       2° Where he fails to furnish the lender with the security promised by the contract.
 Art. 1913

 the debtor.

       “Where a deposit which exceeds the figure provided for in Article 1341 is not proved in writing” (Act no 80-525 of 12
 July 1980), the one who is sued as depositary is believed on his declaration, either as to the fact itself of the deposit, or
 as to the thing which was its object, or as to the fact of its restitution.
 Art. 1925
       A voluntary deposit may take place only between persons capable of contracting.
       Nevertheless, where a person capable of contracting accepts a deposit made by a person under a disability, he is
 liable for all the obligations of a true depositary; he may be sued by the guardian or administrator of the person who
 made the deposit.
 Art. 1926
       Where a deposit was made by a person who is capable to a person who is not, the person who made the deposit
 has only a claim for the recovery of the thing deposited, so long as it exists in the hands of the depositary, or a claim in
 restitution up to the amount of the benefit derived by the latter.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Obligations of a Depositary
 Art. 1927
 Articles 1927 to 1946

 things which belong to him.
 Art. 1928
       The provision of the preceding Article shall be applied more strictly:
       1° Where the depositary has volunteered for receiving the deposit;
       2° Where he has stipulated a salary for the keeping of the deposit;
       3° Where the deposit has been made solely in the interest of the depositary;
       4° Where it has been expressly agreed that the depositary would be liable for any kind of fault.

 Art. 1931
       He may not attempt to know what the things are which have been deposited with him, when they have been
 entrusted to him in a closed chest or under a sealed cover.
 Art. 1932
       A depositary must return the exact same thing which he has received.
       Thus, a deposit of sums of money must be returned in the same coins in which it was made, either in the case of
 increase or in the case of decrease of their value.
 Art. 1933
       A depositary is only bound to return the thing deposited in the condition in which it is at the time of restitution.
 Deteriorations which did not occur through his act shall be borne by the depositor.

CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1936
       Where a thing deposited has produced fruits which were collected by the depositary, he is obliged to return them.
 He owes no interest on money deposited, except from the day when he has been given notice to make the restitution.
 Art. 1937
       A depositary must return the thing deposited only to the one who has entrusted it to him, or to the one in whose
 name the deposit was made, or to the one who has been designated to receive it.
 Art. 1938
       He may not require the one who made the deposit to prove that he was the owner of the thing deposited.
       Nevertheless, where he discovers that the thing has been stolen, and who the true owner is, he must give the latter
 notice of the deposit which was made to him, with demand to claim it within a determined and sufficient period. Where
 the one to whom notice has been given fails to claim the deposit, the depositary is lawfully discharged by the handing
 over of it to the one from whom he received it.
 Art. 1939
       In case of [...] death of the person who made the deposit, the thing deposited may be returned only to his heir.
       Where there are several heirs, it must be returned to each of them for their share and portion.
       Where the thing deposited is indivisible, the heirs must agree between them to receive it.
 Art. 1940
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Where the person who has made the deposit has been deprived of his powers of administration, the deposit may be
 returned only to the one who has the administration of the property of the depositor.
 Art. 1941
 (Act no 85-1372 of 23 Dec. 1985)
       Where a deposit has been made by a guardian or an administrator, in one of these capacities, it may be returned
 only to the person whom the guardian or administrator represented, if their management or administration has come to
 an end.
 Art. 1942
       Where the contract of deposit specifies the place where the restitution must be made, the depositary is bound to
 bring the thing deposited to that place. Where there are transport costs, they shall be charged to the depositor.
 Art. 1943
       Where the contract does not specify the place of restitution, it must be done in the very place of the deposit.
 Art. 1944
       A deposit must be returned to the depositor as soon as he claims it, even where the contract has fixed a determined
 period for the restitution; unless there is in the hands of the depositary an attachment or a forbidding to return and
 remove the thing deposited.
 Art. 1945
       [repealed by implication]
 Art. 1946
       All the obligations of a depositary come to an end where he happens to discover and prove that he is himself the
 owner of the thing deposited.
                        SECTION IV
                        Of the Obligations of the Person by Whom a Deposit was Made
 Art. 1947
 Articles 1947 to 1948
       The person who made a deposit is bound to reimburse the depositary for expenses incurred for the preservation of
 the thing deposited, and to indemnify him for all the losses which the deposit may have occasioned him.

                        SECTION V
                        Of Necessary Deposits
 Art. 1949
 Articles 1949 to 1954
       A necessary deposit is one which was forced by some accident, such as a fire, ruin, pillage, shipwreck or other
 unforeseen event.
 Art. 1950
 (Act no 80-525 of 12 July 1980)
       Proof by witnesses may be admitted as to a necessary deposit, although the amount concerned exceeds the figure
 provided for by Article 1341.
 Art. 1951
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 222/268
CIVIL CODE
       As to other issues, a necessary deposit shall be governed by all the rules previously laid down.
 Art. 1952
 (Act no 73-1141 of 24 Dec. 1973)
       Innkeepers or hotel-keepers are liable, as depositaries, for clothes, luggage and various effects brought into their
 business premises by a traveller lodging with them; the deposit of effects of that kind shall be considered as a necessary
 deposit.
 Art. 1953
 (Act no 73-1141 of 24 Dec. 1973)
       They are liable for theft or for damage to those effects, whether the theft was committed or the damage caused by
 their servants or employees, or by strangers going to and fro in the hotel.
       That liability is unlimited, notwithstanding any clause to the contrary, in case of theft or deterioration of all kinds of
 effects deposited within their hands or which they refused to receive without rightful reason.
       In all other cases, damages due to a traveller are, to the exclusion of any agreed lower limitation, limited to the
 equivalent of one-hundred times the price of rental of lodging per day, except when the traveller proves that the damage
 he has suffered results from a fault of the person who shelters him or of the persons for whom the latter is responsible.
 Art. 1954
 (Act no 73-1141 of 24 Dec. 1973)
       Innkeepers or hotel-keepers are not liable for thefts or damage which happen through force majeure, nor for the
 loss which results from the nature or from a defect of the thing, on condition that they prove the fact which they allege.
       In derogation to the provisions of Article 1953, innkeepers or hotel-keepers are responsible for the objects left in
 vehicles parked on a place of which they have private enjoyment up to the amount of fifty times the price of rental of
 lodging per day.
       Articles 1952 and 1953 shall not apply to living animals.
                CHAPTER III
                Of Sequestrations
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Various Kinds of Sequestration
 Art. 1955
       Sequestration is either conventional or judicial.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Conventional Sequestration
 Art. 1956
 Articles 1955 to 1963
 Article 1955
 Articles 1956 to 1960
       Conventional sequestration is a deposit made by one or several persons, of a thing in contest, into the hands of a
 third party who binds himself to return it, after the controversy is over, to the person who will be judged entitled to obtain
 it.
 Art. 1957
       Sequestration need not be gratuitous.
 Art. 1958
       Where it is gratuitous, it is governed by the rules of an actual deposit, subject to the differences hereinafter stated.
 Art. 1959
       Sequestration may have as its object not only movable effects, but also immovables.
 Art. 1960
       A depositary in charge of a sequestration may be discharged, before the end of the controversy, only by consent of
 all the interested parties, or for a reason judged rightful.
                        SECTION III
                        Of Judicial Sequestration or Deposit
 Art. 1961
       A court may order sequestration:
       1° Of movables seized on a debtor;
 Articles 1961 to 1963
       2° Of an immovable or of a movable thing whose ownership or possession is in contest between two or several
 persons;
       3° Of things which a debtor tenders in order to be discharged.
 Art. 1962
       The appointment of a judicial custodian produces reciprocal obligations between the attaching party and the
 custodian. A custodian must give the care of a prudent owner for the preservation of the things seized.
       He must present them, either to the attaching party for being discharged in case of sale, or to the party against
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 223/268
CIVIL CODE
 whose property execution has been levied, in case of cancellation of the seizure.
       The obligation of an attaching party consists in paying the custodian the salary fixed by law.
 Art. 1963
       Judicial sequestration shall be given, either to a person agreed upon by the parties concerned, or to a person
 appointed by the judge of his own motion.
       In either case, the one to whom a thing is entrusted is subject to all the obligations which a conventional
 sequestration involves.
        TITLE XII
        OF ALEATORY CONTRACTS
 Art. 1964
 Articles 1965 to 1964
       An aleatory contract is a reciprocal agreement whose effects, as to advantages and to losses, either for all the
 parties, or for one or several of them, depend upon an uncertain event.
       Such are:
       Insurance contracts;
       Bottomry contracts;
       Gaming and betting;
       Contracts for life annuity.
       The first two are governed by maritime law.
                CHAPTER I
                Of Gaming and Betting
 Art. 1965
       Legislation does not grant any action for a gaming debt or for the payment of a bet.
 Art. 1966
 Articles 1965 to 1967
       Games proper to train in the use of arms, foot or horse races, chariot races, tennis and other games of the same
 kind which involve skill and bodily exercise, are excepted from the precedent provision.
       Nevertheless, the court may dismiss the complaint where the sum seems excessive.
 Art. 1967
       In no case may the loser recover what he has voluntarily paid, unless there was, on the part of the winner,
 deception, fraud or swindling.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Contract for Life Annuity
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Requisites for the Validity of the Contract
 Art. 1968
 Articles 1968 to 1983
 Articles 1968 to 1976
       A life annuity may be settled for value, for a sum of money or for a valuable movable thing, or for an immovable.
 Art. 1969
       It may also be settled, purely gratuitously, by gift inter vivos or by will. It must then bear the forms required by
 legislation.
 Art. 1970
       In the case of the preceding Article, a life annuity may be abated, where it exceeds what one is allowed to dispose
 of; it is void, where it is for the benefit of a person incapable of receiving it.
 Art. 1971
       A life annuity may be settled either on the head of the one who furnishes the price of it, or on the head of a third
 person, who has no right to enjoy it.
 Art. 1972
       It may be settled on one or several heads.
 Art. 1973
       It may settled for the benefit of a third person, although the price is paid by another person.
       In the latter case, although it has the character of a gratuitous transfer, it is not subject to the forms required for
 gifts; except for the cases of abatement and avoidance stated in Article 1970.
       (Act no 63-1092 of 6 Nov. 1963) Where, settled by spouses or one of them, an annuity is stipulated to be revertible
 in favour of the surviving spouse, the clause which imports that property is to revert to him or her may have the
 character of a gratuitous transfer or that of a transaction for value. In that latter case, the reimbursement or the
 indemnity owed by the beneficiary of the reversion to the community or to the succession of the predeceaser  is equal to
 the value of the reversion of the annuity. Except for contrary intention of the spouses, an annuity is deemed to have
 been granted gratuitously.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 224/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1974
       A contract for life annuity created on the head of a person who was dead at the day of the contract does not
 produce any effect.
 Art. 1975
       It shall be the same for a contract by which an annuity was created on the head of a person suffering from an illness
 of which he died within twenty days after the date of the contract.
 Art. 1976
       A life annuity may be settled at the rate which it please the parties to fix.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Effects of the Contract between the Contracting Parties
 Art. 1977
 Articles 1977 to 1983
       The one in whose favour a life annuity was settled for a price may apply for the termination of the contract where the
 grantor does not give the guarantees stipulated for its performance.
 Art. 1978
       The mere failure to pay the income of the annuity does not entitle the one in whose favour it is settled to apply for
 the reimbursement of the capital or to re-enter into the tenement transferred by him: he only has the right to seize and
 have the property of his debtor sold and to have ordered or agreed that, out of the proceeds of the sale, a sufficient sum
 be invested for the payment of the income.
 Art. 1979
       A grantor may not exonerate himself from paying the annuity, by offering to reimburse the capital, and waiving
 recovery of the income paid; he is bound to pay the annuity during the whole life of the person or persons on whose
 heads the annuity was settled, whatever the duration of the life of those persons may be and however onerous the
 payment of the annuity may have become.
 Art. 1980
       A life annuity is acquired by the annuitant only in proportion to the number of days he has lived.
       Nevertheless, where it was agreed that it would be paid in advance, the instalment which ought to be paid is
 acquired from the day when its payment ought to be made.
 Art. 1981
       A life annuity may be stipulated to be exempt from execution only where it was settled gratuitously.
 Art. 1982
       [repealed by implication]
 Art. 1983
       The annuitant of an annuity may claim income only by proving his existence, or that of the person on whose head it
 was settled.
        TITLE XIII
        OF AGENCY
                CHAPTER I
                Of the Nature and Form of Agency
 Art. 1984
 Articles 1984 to 2010
 Articles 1984 to 1990
       An agency or power of attorney is a transaction by which a person gives to another the authority to do something for
 the principal and in his name.
       An agency  is formed only through acceptance of the agent.
 Art. 1985
       “An agency may be given by an authentic instrument or by an instrument under private signature, even by letter. It
 may also be given verbally, but proof of it by witness is received only in accordance with the Title Of Contracts or of
 Conventional Obligations in General"(Act no 80-525 of 12 July 1980).
       Acceptance of an agency may be only tacit and result from the performance of it effected by the agent.
 Art. 1986
       An agency is gratuitous, unless there is an agreement to the contrary.
 Art. 1987
       It is either special and for one or several deals only, or general and for all the affairs of the principal.
 Art. 1988
       An agency worded in general terms includes only acts of administration.
       Where it is intended to transfer or mortgage, or do some other transaction relating to ownership, the agency must
 be express.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 225/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 1989
       An agent may do nothing beyond what is expressed in his agency: the authority to compromise does not include
 that to enter into an arbitration agreement.
 Art. 1990
 (Act no 65-570 of 13 July 1965)
       A non-emancipated minor may be chosen as an agent; but the principal has an action against him only in
 accordance with the general rules relating to the obligations of minors.
                CHAPTER II
                Of the Obligations of the Agent
 Art. 1991
 Articles 1991 to 1997
       An agent is bound to perform the agency so long as he responsible for it, and is liable for the damages which may
 result from his non-performance.
       He is also bound at the death of the principal to complete a matter initiated, where there is danger in delay.
 Art. 1992
       An agent is liable not only for intentional breach, but also for faults committed in his management.
       Nevertheless, the liability for faults is implemented less rigorously against the one whose agency is gratuitous than
 against the one receiving a salary.
 Art. 1993
       Every agent is bound to account for his management, and to return to the principal all that he received by virtue of
 his power of attorney, even where what he received was not owed to the principal.
 Art. 1994
       An agent answers for the one whom he has substituted for himself in his management: 1° where he did not receive
 the authority to substitute someone; 2° where that authority was granted to him without designation of a person and the
 one whom he has chosen was notoriously incompetent or insolvent.
       In all cases, a principal may directly sue the person whom the agent has substituted for himself.
 Art. 1995
       Where there are several proxies or agents appointed by the same instrument, there is no joint and several liability
 between them, unless it is expressed. 
Art. 1996
       An agent owes interest on sums employed for his own use, from that use; and on those of which he is debtor for the
 balance, from the day when he is given notice.
 Art. 1997
       An agent who has given the party with whom he contracts, in that capacity, a sufficient knowledge of his authority is
 not held to any warranty for what has been made outside the scope of that authority, unless he has personally taken
 charge of it.
                CHAPTER III
                Of the Obligations of the Principal
 Art. 1998
 Articles 1998 to 2002
       A principal is bound to perform the undertakings contracted by the agent, in accordance with the authority granted
 to him.
       He is bound for what may have been done outside its scope, only where he has expressly or tacitly ratified it.
 Art. 1999
       A principal must reimburse the agent for the advances and expenses which the latter made for the performance of
 the agency, and pay him his salary where it has been promised.
       Where no fault may be ascribed to the agent, the principal may not dispense with making those reimbursements
 and payments, even if the matter did not succeed, and he may not have the amount of the expenses and advances
 reduced on the pretext that they could have cost less.
 Art. 2000
       A principal must also compensate the agent for the losses which the latter has incurred on the occasion of his
 management, without an imprudent act being ascribable to him.
 Art. 2001
       Interest on the advances made by the agent is owed to him by the principal, from the day of the advances which are
 proved.
 Art. 2002
       Where an agent has been appointed by several persons, for a common affair, each of them is jointly and severally
 liable towards him for all the effects of the agency.

Articles 2003 to 2010
 CIVIL CODE
                CHAPTER IV
                Of the Different Ways in Which an Agency Comes to an End
 Art. 2003
       An agency comes to an end:
       By the revocation of the agent;
       By the renunciation of the agency by the latter;
       By the [..] death, guardianship of adults or insolvency, either of the principal, or of the agent.
 Art. 2004
       A principal may revoke his power of attorney when he pleases and compel, if there is occasion, the agent to return
 to him, either the instrument under private signature which contains it, or the original of the power of attorney, where it
 has been delivered without being recorded, or the office copy, where the original has been kept.
 Art. 2005
       A revocation of which only the agent has been given notice is not effective against third parties who have dealt
 without knowing of that revocation, except for the remedy of the principal against the agent.
 Art. 2006
       The appointment of a new agent for the same affair involves revocation of the first one, from the day when notice of
 it has been given to the latter.
 Art. 2007
       An agent may renounce the agency by giving notice of his renunciation to the principal.
       Nevertheless, where that renunciation prejudices the principal, he must be compensated by the agent, unless the
 latter is unable to continue the agency without himself suffering a considerable loss.
 Art. 2008
       Where an agent has no knowledge of the death of the principal or of one of the other causes which make an agency
 come to an end, what he has done in that ignorance is valid.
 Art. 2009
       In the above cases, the undertakings of the agent shall be performed with regard to third parties who are in good
 faith.
 Art. 2010
       In case of death of an agent, his heirs must give notice of it to the principal, and, in the meantime, attend to what the
 circumstances may require in the interest of the latter.
        TITLE XIV
        [repealed;  Art. 2011 to 2043 removed to Art. 2288 to 2320]
        TITLE XV
        OF COMPROMISES
 Art. 2044
 Articles 2044 to 2058
       A compromise is a contract by which the parties settle an arisen controversy, or prevent a controversy from arising.
       That contract must be made in writing.
 Art. 2045
       In order to compromise, one must have the capacity to dispose of the things included in the compromise.
       A guardian may compromise on behalf of a minor or of an adult in guardianship only in accordance with Article 467,
 in the Title Of Minors, of Guardianship and of Emancipation; and he may compromise with a minor come of age with
 respect to the account of guardianship only in accordance with Article 472 of the same Title.
       communes and public institutions may compromise only with the express authorization of the President of the
 Republic.
 Art. 2046
       A compromise may take place as to civil interests resulting from an offence.
       The compromise does not prevent prosecution by the Government procurator’s office.
 Art. 2047
       One may add to a compromise the stipulation of a penalty against the party who fails to perform it.
 Art. 2048
       Compromises are confined to their purpose: a renunciation made therein of all rights, actions and claims extends
 only to what relates to the controversy about which the compromise has arisen.
 Art. 2049
       Compromises regulate only the controversies which are comprised therein, whether the parties have expressed
 their intention in special or general terms, or that intention comes out as a necessary consequence of what is expressed.
 Art. 2050
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 227/268
CIVIL CODE
       Where a person who has made a compromise as to a right which he had in his own name acquires afterwards a
 similar right in the name of another person, he is not bound by the compromise previously made with respect to the right
 newly acquired.
 Art. 2051
       A compromise made by one of the interested parties does not bind the others and may not be invoked by them.
 Art. 2052
       Compromises have, between the parties, the authority of res judicata of a final judgment.
       They may not be attacked on account of an error of law, nor on account of loss.
 Art. 2053
       Nevertheless, a compromise may be rescinded, where there is an error as to the person or as to the subject-matter
 of the controversy.
       It may also be rescinded where there is deception or duress.
 Art. 2054
       An action for rescission of a compromise also lies where it has been made in execution of an instrument which is
 void, unless the parties have expressly dealt about the nullity.
 Art. 2055
       A compromise made on documents which have since then been found false is entirely void.
 Art. 2056
       A compromise made as to a suit come to an end owing to a judgment having force of res judicata, of which the
 parties or one of them were not aware, is void.
       Where the judgment unknown to the parties was subject to appeal, the compromise is valid.
 Art. 2057
       Where the parties have compromised generally on all the matters which they might have with one another, the
 instruments which were then unknown to them and which may have been afterwards discovered, are not a ground for
 rescission, unless they have been kept through the act of one of the parties.
       But the compromise is void where it relates to one matter only to which it is proved, by the newly discovered
 instruments, that one of the parties had no right.
 Art. 2058
       An error of calculation in a compromise must be corrected.
        TITLE XVI

 Art. 2059
 Articles 2059 to 2062
 to 2070

 Art. 2060
       One may not enter into arbitration agreements in matters of status and capacity of the persons, in those relating to
 divorce and judicial separation or on controversies concerning public bodies and institutions and more generally in all
 matters in which public policy is concerned.
       (Act no 75-596 of 9 July 1975) However, categories of public institutions of an industrial or commercial character
 may be authorized by decree to enter into arbitration agreements.
 Art. 2061
 (Act no 2001-420 of 15 May 2001)
       Except where there are particular statutory provisions, an arbitration clause is valid in the contracts concluded by
 reason of a professional activity.

 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 228/268
CIVIL CODE
 Art. 2204
       A creditor may sue for a forced sale: 1° of immovable property and of its accessories deemed to be immovables
 belonging in ownership to his debtor; 2° of a usufruct belonging to his debtor on property of the same nature.
 Art. 2204-1
 (Act no 72-626 of 5 July 1972)
       The proceedings and forced sale produce towards the parties and third parties the effects determined by the Code
 of Civil Procedure.
 Art. 2205
       (Ord. no 2006-346 of 23 March 2006) Leases granted by a debtor under a seizure or attachment, whatever their
 duration may be, are not enforceable against the creditors who levy execution.
 Art. 2206
       The immovables of a minor, even emancipated, or of an adult in guardianship may not be put up for sale before
 seizure and sale of the movables.
 Art. 2207
       Seizure and sale of the movables are not required before a forced sale of the immovables possessed in undivided
 ownership by an adult and a minor or an adult in guardianship, where the debt is common to them, or where
 proceedings have been initiated against an adult or before the guardianship of adults.
 Art. 2208
       [repealed]
 Art. 2209
       A creditor may enforce the sale of the immovables which are not mortgaged to him, only in the case of insufficiency
 of the property mortgaged to him.
 Art. 2210
       A forced sale of items of property situated in different arrondissements  may only be instigated successively, unless
 they are part of a same business.
       It shall take place in the court in whose territory the main place of the business is, or failing a main place, the part of
 the property which brings in the greatest income, according to the assessment roll.
 Art. 2211
       Where the items of property mortgaged to the creditor and those not mortgaged, or those situated in different
 arrondissements , form part of one and the same business, the sale of the whole shall be enforced at the same time, if
 the debtor so requires; and the proceeds of the auction shall be itemized, if there is occasion.
 Art. 2212
       Where a debtor proves, by authentic leases, that the net and free income of his immovables for a year, is sufficient
 for payment of the debt in capital, interest and costs, and where he offers the assignment thereof to the creditor, the
 proceedings may be suspended by the judges, subject to their being resumed if there occurs some attachment or
 obstacle to the payment.
 Art. 2213
       A forced sale of immovables may be enforced only under a judgment or an authentic instrument, for a certain and
 liquid debt. Where the debt is for a ready money, not liquidated, the proceedings are valid; but the auction may be held
 only after the liquidation.
 Art. 2214
       The assignee of a judgment or of an authentic instrument may sue for a forced sale only after notice of the
 assignment has been served on the debtor.
 Art. 2215
       The proceedings may take place under a provisional or final judgment, provisorily enforceable, notwithstanding an
 appeal; but an auction may be made only after a final  judgment, without possibility of appeal, or become res judicata.
       The proceedings may not be instituted under default judgments during the period for application to set the judgment
 aside.
 Art. 2216
       Proceedings may not be annulled on the pretext that the creditor has instituted them for a larger sum than what is
 owed to him.
 Art. 2217
       Any proceedings for forced sale must be preceded by an order to pay served, at the suit and request of the creditor,
 on the person of the debtor or at his domicile, through a bailiff.
       “For purpose of their being recorded, the orders to pay bearing on shares depending on an immovable subject to
 the status of co-ownership shall be deemed not to bear on the portion of common parts which is included in those
 shares.
       “Nevertheless, the seizing creditors shall enforce their rights on the said portion, taken in its consistence at the time

        TITLE XX
        OF PRESCRIPTION AND OF POSSESSION
                CHAPTER I
                General Provisions
 Art. 2219
 Articles 2219 to 2283
 Articles 2219 to 2227
       Prescription is a manner of acquiring or of discharging oneself at the end of a certain time and subject to the
 conditions determined by law.
 Art. 2220
       Prescription may not be renounced beforehand: a prescription which has accrued may be renounced.
 Art. 2221
       A renunciation of prescription may be express or implied: implied renunciation results from an act which implies
 waiver of the right acquired.
 Art. 2222
       A person who has not the power of alienation does not have the power of renunciation of a prescription which has
 accrued..
 Art. 2223
       Judges may not supply of their own motion a plea of prescription.
 Art. 2224
       Prescription may be set up at all stages of a case, even before a court of appeal, unless the party who had not set
 up the plea of prescription should be presumed, by reason of the circumstances, to have renounced it.
 Art. 2225
       Creditors, or any other person having an interest in the prescription's being accrued, may set it up, although the
 debtor or owner renounces it.
 Art. 2226
       One may not prescribe the ownership of things which may not be the subject matter of legal transactions between
 private individuals.
 Art. 2227
       The State, public institutions and communes are subject to the same prescriptions as private individuals, and may
 likewise set them up.
                CHAPTER II
                Of Possession
 Art. 2228
 Articles 2228 to 2235
       Possession is the detention or enjoyment of a thing or of a right which we hold or exercise by ourselves, or by
 another who holds and exercises it in our name.
 Art. 2229
       In order to be allowed to prescribe, one must have a continuous and uninterrupted, peaceful, public and
 unequivocal possession, and in the capacity of an owner.
 Art. 2230
       One is always presumed to possess for oneself, and in the capacity of an owner, where it is not proved that one has
 begun by possessing for another.
 Art. 2231
       Where one has begun by possessing for another, one is always presumed to possess in the same capacity, unless
 there is proof to the contrary.
 Art. 2232
       Acts which are merely allowed or simply tolerated may not give rise to possession or prescription.
 Art. 2233
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 230/268
CIVIL CODE
       Acts of duress may not give rise to a possession capable of bringing about prescription either.
       Possession begins to produce effects only from the time the duress has ceased.
 Art. 2234
       A present possessor who proves that he has formerly possessed, is presumed to have possessed during the
 intervening time, unless there is proof to the contrary.
 Art. 2235
       To complete a prescription, one may join to one's possession that of one's predecessor, in whatever manner one
 may have succeeded to him, whether by virtue of a universal or specific title, or for value or gratuitously.
                CHAPTER III
                Of the Causes Which Prevent Prescription
 Art. 2236
 Articles 2236 to 2241
       Those who possess for another never acquire ownership by prescription, whatever the time elapsed may be.
       Thus a farm tenant, a depositary, a usufructuary, and all those who precariously hold the thing of an owner, may not
 prescribe it.
 Art. 2237
       The heirs of those who held the thing on any of the bases designated in the preceding Article, may not prescribe
 either.
 Art. 2238
       Nevertheless, the persons mentioned in Articles 2236 and 2237 may prescribe where the basis of their possession
 is reversed, either owing to a cause arising from a third party, or by an adverse claim they have raised against the right
 of the owner.
 Art. 2239
       Those to whom farm tenants, depositaries or usufructuaries and other persons who hold precariously have
 transmitted the thing by a conveyance, may prescribe it.
 Art. 2240
       One may not prescribe against one's own title, in the sense that one may not modify as to himself the cause and
 principle of his possession.
 Art. 2241
       One may prescribe against one's title, in the sense that one prescribes the discharge of an obligation which one has
 contracted.
                CHAPTER IV
                Of the Causes Which Interrupt or Suspend the Running of Prescription
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Causes Which Interrupt Prescription
 Art. 2242
       Prescription may be interrupted either naturally or according to law.
 Art. 2243
 Articles 2242 to 2259
 Articles 2242 to 2250
       Natural interruption takes place where a possessor is deprived of the enjoyment of the thing, for more than one
 year, either by the previous owner, or even by a third person.
 Art. 2244
 (Act no 85-677 of 5 July 1985)
       A service of process, even for interim relief, an order to pay or a seizure, on the person whom one wishes to prevent
 from prescribing, interrupt prescription, as well as the periods within which an action must be brought.
 Art. 2245
       An application for conciliation before the [arrondissement] interrupts prescription from the day of its date, where it is
 followed by a service of process in due time.
 Art. 2246
       A service of process, even before a judge without jurisdiction, interrupts prescription.
 Art. 2247
       Where a summons is void by infringement of a procedural requirement,
       Where the plaintiff discontinues his claim,
       Where he leaves the suit to lapse,
       Or where he is defeated in his claim,
       Interruption shall be deemed never to have occurred.
 Art. 2248
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 231/268
CIVIL CODE
       Prescription is interrupted where the debtor or possessor acknowledges the right of the person against whom he
 was prescribing.
 Art. 2249
       A service of process made in accordance with the above Articles upon one of the joint and several debtors, or his
 acknowledgement, interrupts prescription against all the others, and even against their heirs.
       A service of process made upon one of the heirs of a joint and several debtor or an acknowledgement by that heir
 does not interrupt prescription against the other coheirs, even if the claim is secured by a mortgage, where it is not
 indivisible.
       That service of process or that acknowledgement interrupts prescription, with regard to the other co-debtors, only
 for the share for which that heir is liable.
       In order to interrupt prescription for the whole, with regard to the other co-debtors, it is necessary to have a service
 made on all the heirs of the deceased debtor, or an acknowledgement of all the heirs.
 Art. 2250
       A service made upon a principal debtor, or his acknowledgement, interrupts prescription against the surety.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Causes Which Suspend the Running of Prescription
 Art. 2251
 Articles 2251 to 2259
       Prescription runs against all persons, unless they come within some exception established by law.
 Art. 2252

       Prescription does not run against non-emancipated minors and adults in guardianship, except for what is stated in
 Article 2278 and with the exception of the other cases determined by law.
 Art. 2253
       It does not run between spouses.
 Art. 2254
       Although there is no separation resulting from an ante-nuptial agreement or a judgment, prescription runs against a
 married woman, with regard to the property of which the husband has the administration, subject to her remedy against
 the husband.
 Art. 2255 and 2256
       [repealed]
 Art. 2257
       The statute of limitations does not run :
       With regard to a chose in action which depends upon a condition, until that condition occurs;
       With regard to a claim on a warranty, until dispossession has taken place;
       With regard to a chose in action on a fixed day, until that day has occurred.
 Art. 2258
       The statute of limitations does not run against a heir under benefit of inventory, with regard to claims which he has
 against the succession.
       It runs against a succession which is vacant, although not provided with a curator.
 Art. 2259
       It still runs during the three months allowed for making an inventory and the forty days for deliberating.
                CHAPTER V
                Of the Time Required to Prescribe
                        SECTION I
                        General Provisions
 Art. 2260
       Prescription is counted by days and not by hours.
 Art. 2261
       It accrues when the last day of the period is over.
                        SECTION II
                        Of Thirty-Year Prescription
 Art. 2262
 Articles 2260 to 2281
 Articles 2260 to 2261
 Articles 2262 to 2264
       All claims, in rem as well as in personam, are prescribed by thirty years, without the person who alleges that
 prescription being obliged to adduce a title, or a plea resulting from bad faith being allowed to be set up against him.
 Art. 2263
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 232/268
CIVIL CODE
       After twenty-eight years from the date of the last instrument of title, the debtor of an annuity may be compelled to

 to them.

 where the true owner lives on the territory of the court of appeal within whose limits the immovable is situated; and by
 twenty years, where he is domiciled outside of the said territory.
 Art. 2266
       Where the true owner has had his domicile at different times, within and outside the territory, one must, in order to
 complete the prescription, add to what is lacking to make up ten years of presence, a number of years of absence twice
 what is lacking to complete the ten years of presence.
 Art. 2267
       An instrument which is void for a defect as to its form may not serve as the basis for a prescription by ten and
 twenty years.
 Art. 2268
       Good faith is always presumed, and it is on the person who alleges bad faith to prove it.
 Art. 2269
       It is sufficient that good faith has existed at the time of the acquisition.
 Art. 2270
 (Act no 78-12 of 4 Jan. 1978)
       Any natural or juridical person who may be liable under Articles 1792 to 1792-4 of this Code is discharged from the

        TITLE I
        OF PERSONAL SECURITIES
 Article 2287-1
 Articles 2288 to
 2287-1
       Personal securities regulated by this Title are suretyship, independent guarantee and letter of intent.
                CHAPTER I
                Of Suretyship
                        SECTION I
                        Of the Nature and Extent of Suretyship
 Article 2288
 Articles 2288 to 2320
 Articles 2288 to 2297
       A person who makes himself surety for an obligation binds himself towards the creditor to perform that obligation, if
 the debtor does not perform it himself. [ex Art. 2011]
 Article 2289
       A suretyship may exist only on a valid obligation.
       One may nevertheless stand surety for an obligation, although it may be avoided by a defence purely personal to
 the obligor; for instance, in case of minority. [ex Art. 2012]
 Article 2290
       A suretyship may not exceed  what is owed by the debtor, nor be contracted under more onerous conditions.
       It may be contracted for a part of the debt only, and under less onerous conditions.
       A suretyship which exceeds the debt, or which is contracted under more onerous conditions, is not void: it is only
 reducible to the extent of the principal obligation. [ex Art. 2013]
 Article 2291
       One may become surety without an order of the person for whom one becomes bound, and even without his
 knowledge.
       One may also become surety, not only of the principal debtor, but also of the person who has given security for him.
 [ex Art. 2014]
 Article 2292
       Suretyship is not presumed; it must be express, and one may not extend it beyond the limits within which it was
 contracted. [ex Art. 2015]
 Article 2293
       Indefinite suretyship of a principal obligation extends to the accessories of the debt, even to the costs of the first
 claim, and to all those subsequent to the notice given of it to the surety.
       Where that suretyship is contracted by a natural person, the latter shall be informed by the creditor of the evolution
 of the amount of the debt secured and of those accessories at least once a year at the date agreed between the parties
 or, failing which, at the anniversary date of the contract, on pain of forfeiture of all the accessories of the debts, costs
 and penalties. [ex Art. 2016]
 Article 2294
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 235/268
CIVIL CODE
       The undertakings of the sureties, except judicial constraint, pass to their heirs, where the undertaking was such that
 the surety was bound to it. [ex Art. 2017]
 Article 2295
       A debtor compelled to give a surety must present one who has capacity to contract, sufficient property to answer for
 the subject matter of the obligation, and whose domicile is in the territory of the cour d'appel where it must be given. [ex
 Art. 2018]
 Article 2296
       The solvency of a surety shall be appreciated only with regard to his landed property except in matters of
 commerce, or where the debt is moderate.
       Regard shall not be had to immovables in dispute or whose seizure and forced sale would be too difficult because
 of remoteness of their location. [ex Art. 2019]
 Article 2297
       Where a surety received by the creditor, voluntarily or in court, becomes afterwards insolvent, a new one shall be
 given.
       The sole exception to that rule takes place where the surety was given only under an agreement by which the
 creditor required such a person as surety. [ex Art. 2020]
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Effect of Suretyship
                                Sub-section 1
                                Of the Effect of Suretyship between Creditor and Surety
 Article 2298
 Articles 2298 to 2310
 Articles 2298 to 2304
       A surety is bound towards the creditor to pay him only upon the debtor's failure, whose property must be previously
 exhausted, unless the surety has renounced the benefit of seizure and sale*, or unless he is bound jointly and severally
 with the debtor, in which case the effect of his undertaking is governed by the principles established for joint and several
 debts. [ex Art. 2021]
 Article 2299
       A creditor is bound to exhaust the main debtor's property only where the surety requires him to do so, on the
 institution of proceedings against the latter. [ex Art. 2022]
 Article 2300
       A surety who requires seizure and sale must point out to the creditor the property of the principal debtor and furnish
 a sufficient sum to have the proceedings carried out.
       He may not point out property of the principal debtor situated out of the arrondissement of the cour d'appel of the
 place where payment must be made, nor property which is in litigation, nor that which is mortgaged for the debt and no
 longer in the possession of the debtor. [ex Art. 2023]
 Article 2301
       Whenever the surety has pointed out the property authorized by the preceding Article and has furnished a sufficient
 sum to have the seizure and sale carried out, the creditor is, to the extent of the property pointed out, liable towards the
 surety for the insolvency of the principal debtor which has occurred in consequence of his failure to institute
 proceedings. In any case, the amount of the debts resulting from a suretyship may not have the effect of depriving a
 natural person who stood as surety of a minimum income fixed by Article L. 331-2 of the Consumer Code. [ex Art. 2024]
 Article 2302
       Where several persons have become surety of the same debtor for a same debt, each one is liable for the whole
 debt.  [ex Art. 2025]
 Article 2303
       Nevertheless, each one, unless he has renounced the benefit of division*, may demand that the creditor previously
 divide his action and reduce it to the part and portion owed by each surety.
       Where, at the time when one of the sureties had the division effected, some of them were insolvent, that surety is
 proportionately liable for those insolvencies; but he may no longer be sued for insolvencies happening after the division.
 [ex Art. 2026]
 Article 2304
       Where a creditor has himself and voluntarily divided his action, he may not go back on that division, although there
 were insolvent sureties even before the time when he consented thereto. [ex Art. 2027]
                                Sub-section 2
                                Of the Effect of Suretyship between Debtor and Surety
 Article 2305
 Articles 2305 to 2309
       A surety who has paid has his remedy against the principal debtor, whether the suretyship has been given with or
 without the knowledge of the debtor.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 236/268
CIVIL CODE
       That remedy shall take place both for the principal and for the interest and costs; nevertheless, the surety has a
 remedy only for the costs he has incurred since he has given notice to the principal debtor of the proceedings instituted
 against him.
       He also has a remedy for damages, if there is occasion. [ex Art. 2028]
 Article 2306
       A surety who has paid the debt is subrogated to all the rights which the creditor had against the debtor. [ex Art.
 2029]
 Article 2307
       Where there were several principal debtors, jointly and severally liable for a same debt, he who stood as surety for
 them all has, against each of them, a remedy for the recovery of the whole debt. [ex Art. 2030]
 Article 2308
       A surety who paid a first time has no remedy against a principal debtor who paid a second time, where he has not
 informed him of his paying; except for his remedy for recovery against the creditor.
       Where a surety has paid without being sued and without informing the principal debtor, he has no remedy against
 him in the case where, at the time of payment, that debtor would have had arguments to have the debt declared extinct;
 except for his remedy for recovery against the creditor. [ex Art. 2031]
 Article 2309
       Even before paying, a surety may bring suit against the debtor to be indemnified by him:
       1° Where he is sued in court for payment;
       2° Where the debtor is [under a judicial arrangement] or insolvent;
       3° Where the debtor was bound to discharge him within a certain time;
       4° Where the debt has become due by the expiry of the term for which it was contracted;
       5° At the end of ten years, where the principal obligation has no fixed term of maturity, unless the principal
 obligation, such as a guardianship, is not extinguishable before a determinate time. [ex Art. 2032]
                                Sub-section 3
                                Of the Effect of Suretyship between Co-Sureties
 Article 2310
 Article 2310
       Where several persons have been sureties for the same debtor in regard to the same debt, a surety who has
 satisfied the debt has a remedy against the other sureties, for the share and portion of each of them;
       But this remedy only takes place where the surety has paid in one of the cases mentioned in the preceding Article.
 [ex Art. 2033]
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Extinguishment of Suretyship
 Article 2311
 Articles 2311 to 2316
       The obligation which results from a suretyship is extinguished by the same causes as other obligations. [ex Art.
 2034]
 Article 2312
       A merger which takes place in the persons of a principal debtor and his surety, where they become heirs one to the
 other, does not extinguish the action of the creditor against the person who has stood as surety for the surety. [ex Art.
 2035]
 Article 2313
       A surety may set up against the creditor all the defences which belong to the principal debtor, and which are
 inherent to the debt;
       But he may not set up the defences which are purely personal to the debtor. [ex Art. 2036]
 Article 2314
       A surety is discharged where the subrogation to the rights, mortgages and prior  charges of the creditor, may no
 longer take place in favour of the surety, by the act of that creditor. Any clause to the contrary is deemed not written. [ex
 Art. 2037]
 Article 2315
       The voluntary acceptance on the part of a creditor of an immovable or of any property in payment of the principal
 debt, discharges the surety, even where the creditor is afterwards evicted therefrom. [ex Art. 2038]
 Article 2316
       A mere extension granted by the creditor to the principal debtor does not discharge the surety, who may in that case
 sue the debtor to compel him to pay. [ex Art. 2039]
                        SECTION IV
                        Of Statutory and Judicial Sureties
 Article 2317
 Articles 2317 to 2320
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 237/268
CIVIL CODE
       Whenever a person is bound, by law or by a judgment, to give a surety, the surety tendered must fulfil the
 conditions required in Articles 2295 and 2296.
       Moreover, where a judicial surety is concerned, the surety must be liable to judicial constraint. [ex Art. 2040]
 Article 2318
       A person who cannot find a surety is admitted to give instead a pawn as sufficient pledge. [ex Art. 2041]
 Article 2319
       A judicial surety may not demand the seizure and sale of the principal debtor's property. [ex Art. 2042]
 Article 2320
       A person who has merely become the surety of a judicial surety may not demand the seizure and sale of the
 property of the principal debtor and of the surety. [ex Art. 2043]
                CHAPTER II
                Of Independent Guarantee
 Article 2321
 Article 2321
       An independent guarantee is an undertaking by which the guarantor binds himself, in consideration of a debt
 subscribed by a third party, to pay a sum either on first demand or subject  to terms agreed upon.
       A guarantor is not bound in case of patent abuse or fraud of the beneficiary or of collusion of the latter with the
 principal.
       A guarantor may set up no defence depending on the guaranteed obligation.
       Unless otherwise agreed, that security does not follow the guaranteed obligation.
                CHAPTER III
                Of Letter of Intent
 Article 2322
 Article 2322
       A letter of intent is an undertaking to do or not to do whose purpose is the support provided to a debtor in the
 performance of his obligation in respect of his creditor.

                GENERAL PROVISIONS
 Article 2323
       The lawful causes of priority are prior charges* and mortgages. [ex Art. 2094]
 Article 2324
 Articles 2323 to 2373
 Articles 2323 to 2328
       A prior charge* is a right which the character of a debt gives to a creditor to have priority over the other creditors,
 even mortgagees. [ex Art. 2095]
 Article 2325
       Among creditors who have prior charges, the priority is settled by the different characters of the prior charges. [ex
 Art. 2096]
 Article 2326
       The creditors having prior charges who are in the same rank shall be paid pro rata. [ex Art. 2097]
 Article 2327
       The prior charge by reason of the rights of the Public Treasury and the order in which it comes are regulated by the
 statutes which relate to them.
       The Public Treasury may not, however, obtain a prior charge to the detriment of rights previously vested in third
 parties. [ex Art. 2098]
 Article 2328
       Prior charges may be over movables or over immovables. [ex Art. 2099]
                SUB-TITLE II
                OF SECURITIES OVER MOVABLES
 Article 2329
       Securities over movables are:
       1° Prior charges over movables;
       2° Pledge of corporeal movables;
       3° Pledge of incorporeal movables;
       4° Retention of title as a security.

                                Of Special Prior Charges
 Article 2332
       Debts which have precedence over particular movables are:
 Article 2332
       1° Rents and farm-rents of immovables on the fruit of the year's crop, and on the price of everything which
 garnishes the house rented or the farm, and of everything which is used for the working of the farm: namely, for
 everything which is due, and for everything which shall become due, where the leases are authentic, or, where being
 under private signature, they have an undisputable date; and, in both cases, the other creditors have the right to relet
 the house or the farm for the remainder of the lease, and to profit by the leases or rents, on condition, however, that they
 pay the owner everything which may still be owed to him.
       And, failing authentic leases, or where, being under private signature, they do not have an undisputable date, for
 one year after the expiry of the current year.
       The same prior charge exists for the repairs incumbent upon the tenant and for everything relating to the execution
 of the lease. It also exists for all debts resulting, for the benefit of the owner or tenant, from the occupation of the
 premises, regardless of the basis thereof.
       Nevertheless, the sums owed for seeds, for manure and ameliorators, for anti-cryptogamic and insect products, for
 products designed for the destroying of animal or plant parasites harmful to farming, or for the expenses of the year's
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 239/268

 crop, shall be paid out of the proceeds of the crop, and those owed for implements out of the proceeds of those
 implements, in priority to the owner in either case.
       The owner may seize the movables which furnish his house or his farm, where they have been removed without his
 consent, and he retains his prior charge over them, provided he has made his claim; namely: where the furniture which
 garnished a farm is concerned, within forty day; and within fifteen days, where the furniture garnishing a house is
 concerned;
       2° A debt on the pawn which is in the possession of the creditor;
       3° Expenses incurred for the preservation of a thing;
       4° The price of unpaid movable effects, where they are still in the possession of the debtor, whether he has bought
 on credit or not;
       Where the sale was not made on credit, the seller may even claim back those effects as long as they are in the
 possession of the buyer, and prevent a re-sale, provided the claim is made within eight days after the delivery, and the
 effects are in the same condition in which the delivery was made;
       However, the seller's prior charge may only be enforced after that of the owner of the house or of the farm, unless it
 is proved that the owner knew that the furniture and other articles garnishing his house or his farm did not belong to the
 tenant;
       No change is made in the statutes and customs of commerce relating to claims for recovery;
       5° The supplies of an innkeeper , on the effects of a traveller which have been carried to his inn;
       6° [repealed]
       7° Debts resulting from abuses and unfaithful conducts of public officials in the fulfilment of their duties, on the funds
 of their pawn, and on the interest which may be owed thereon;
       8° Debts arising from an accident for the benefit of the third persons injured in that accident or their assigns, on the
 indemnity of which the insurer, under a contract of liability insurance, admits that he is or has been judicially held debtor
 by reason of the contract of insurance.
       No payment made to the insured person may be in full discharge as long as creditors with prior charges  have not
 been paid off;
       9° Debts arising from a contract of employment of the auxiliary employee of a home worker corresponding to the
 definition of Article L. 721-1 of the Labour Code, on the sums owed to that worker by the hirers of services. [ex Art.
 2102]

                                Of the Rank of Prior Charges
 Article 2332-1
       Unless otherwise provided, special prior charges rank before general prior charges.
 Article 2332-2
 Articles 2332-1 to
 2332-3
       General prior charges shall be enforced in the order settled by Article 2331, save the prior charge of the Public
 Treasury whose rank is regulated by the statutes which relate to it, and the prior charge of social insurance offices which
 ranks equally with the prior charge of employees.
 Article 2332-3
       The special prior charges of a landlord, of a preserver and of a seller of a movable shall be enforced in the following
 order:
       1° The prior charge of a preserver, where the expenses for preservation are subsequent to the rise of the other prior
 charges;
       2° The prior charge of a landlord, who was unaware of the existence of the other prior charges;
       3° The prior charge of a preserver, where the expenses for preservation are antecedent to the rise of the other prior
 charges;
       4° The prior charge of a seller of a movable;
       5° The prior charge of a landlord, who was aware of the existence of the other prior charges.
       Among the preservers of a same movable, priority shall be given to the most recent. Among the sellers of a same
 movable, it shall be given to the earliest.
       For the implementation of the above rules, the prior charge of an innkeeper shall be put on the same footing as that
 of a landlord; and that of the auxiliary employee of a home worker as that of the seller of a movable.

                        Of Pledge of Corporeal Movables

CIVIL CODE
 Article 2334
       A pledge may be given by the debtor or a third party; in the latter case, the creditor may only bring a claim
 concerning the property transferred as security.
 Article 2335
       The pledge of the thing of another is void. It may give rise to damages where the creditor did not know that the thing
 belonged to another.
 Article 2336
       A pledge is complete by the establishing of a writing which contains the description of the debt secured, the quantity
 of the pledged units of property, as well as of their species or nature.
 Article 2337
       A pledge is enforceable against third parties through its being offered to public notice.
       It is so likewise through delivery of the property which it concerns to the creditor or an agreed third party.
       Where a pledge has been duly offered to public notice, the particular successors of the pledgor may not avail
 themselves of Article 2279.
 Article 2338
       A pledge is offered to public notice through registration on a special registry whose details shall be regulated by a
 decree in Conseil d'Etat.
 Article 2339
       A pledgor may require the cancellation of a registration or the restoration of the pledged property only after paying in
 full both the capital and the interest and cost of the secured debt.
 Article 2340
       Where a same property has been the subject matter of several non possessory pledges, the rank of the creditors is
 regulated by the order of their registrations.
       Where a property transferred as a non possessory pledge is subsequently the subject matter of a pawn, the right of
 preference of the previous pledgee creditor is enforceable against the subsequent pledgee creditor where it is duly
 registered notwithstanding the right of retention of the latter.
 Article 2341
       Where a pawn attaches on fungibles, the creditor shall keep them separate from the things of the same nature
 which belong to him. Failing which, the pledgor may avail himself of the provisions of Article 2344, paragraph 1.
       Where the agreement exempts the creditor from that obligation, he acquires the ownership of the pledged things on
 condition to return the same quantity of equivalent things.
 Article 2342
       Where a non possessory pledge attaches on fungibles, the pledgor may dispose of them if the agreement so
 provides on condition to replace them by the same quantity of equivalent things.
 Article 2343
       A pledgor must refund to the creditor or to the third party agreed upon useful or necessary expenses which the latter
 has incurred for the preservation of the pledge.
 Article 2344
       Where the thing is delivered, the pawnor may claim the restoration of the property pawned, without prejudice to
 damages, where the creditor or the third party agreed  upon does not carry out his obligation of preservation of the
 pawn.
       Where there is no delivery of the thing, the creditor may avail himself of the lapse of the term* of the secured debt or
 request an additional pledge if the pledgor does not carry out his obligation of preservation of the pledge.
 Article 2345
       Unless otherwise agreed upon, where the mere possessor of the pledged property is the creditor of the secured
 debt, he collects the increase of that property and appropriates it to the interests or, in their absence, to the capital of the
 debt.
 Article 2346
       In case of failure to pay the secured debt, a creditor may have ordered in court the sale of the pledged property.
 That sale shall take place following the rules on enforcement proceedings to which a contract of pledge may not
 derogate.
 Article 2347
       A creditor may also have ordered in court that the property will remain with him in payment.
       Where the value of the property exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the sum which equals the difference shall
 be paid to the debtor or, if there are other pledgee creditors, shall be deposited.
 Article 2348
       When creating the pledge or afterwards, it may be agreed  that in case of failure to perform the secured obligation,
 the creditor will become owner of the pledged property.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 241/268
CIVIL CODE
       The value of the property shall be determined on the day of the transfer by an expert designated by amicable
 agreement or judicially, in the absence of an official quotation of the property on a regulated market within the meaning
 of the Monetary and Financial Code. Any clause to the contrary is deemed not written.
       Where that value exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the sum which equals the difference shall be paid to the
 debtor or, if there are other pledgee creditors, shall be deposited.
 Article 2349
       A pledge is indivisible notwithstanding the divisibility of the debt between the heirs of the debtor or those of the
 creditor.
       An heir of the debtor, who has paid his portion of the debt, may not claim the restoration of his portion in the pledge,
 so long as the debt is not wholly discharged.
       Reciprocally, an heir of the creditor, who has received his portion of the debt, may not release the pledge to the
 detriment of those of his co-heirs who are not paid. [ex Art. 2083]
 Article 2350
       The deposit of sums, effects or securities, judicially ordered for guarantee or as a provisional measure, involves the
 special lien and the prior charge of Article 2333. [ex Art. 2084]

 Article 2351
 Articles 2351 to 2353
       Where it  attaches to a registered land motor vehicle or a trailer, a pledge is enforceable against third parties
 through the declaration thereof which is made to the administrative authority under the terms prescribed by decree in

 2008].
 Article 2352
       Through the issue of a receipt of the declaration, a pledgor creditor shall be deemed to have kept the pledged
 property in his possession [shall come into force on a date that shall be fixed by decree and which may not be
 subsequent to 1 July 2008].
 Article 2353
       Whatever may be the quality of the debtor, the enforcement of a pledge is subject to the rules provided for in
 Articles 2346 to 2348 [shall come into force on a date that shall be fixed by decree and which may not be subsequent to
 1 July 2008].

                        Of Pledge of Incorporeal Movables
 Article 2355
 Articles 2355 to 2366
       A pledge of an incorporeal thing is the allocation of an incorporeal movable or of a set of incorporeal movables,
 actual or future, as security for an obligation.
       It may be conventional or judicial.
       Judicial pledge is regulated by the rules which apply to enforcement proceedings.
       Failing special provisions, a conventional pledge which attaches to debts is regulated by this Chapter.
       Failing special provisions, a conventional pledge which attaches to other incorporeal movables is regulated by the
 rules laid down for the pledge of corporeal movables.
 Article 2356
       On pain of nullity, the pledge of a debt shall be concluded in writing.
       Debts secured and debts pledged shall be designated in the instrument.
       Where they are future, the instrument must allow their individualization or contain elements which allow it, such as
 the indication of the debtor, the place of payment, the amount of the debts or their estimate and, if there is occasion,
 their due date.
 Article 2357
       Where a pledge attaches to a future debt, the pledgee creditor acquires a right on the debt as from the rise of the
 latter.
 Article 2358
       The pledge of a debt may be established  for a specified time.
       It may attach to a portion of a debt, save where the latter is indivisible.

CIVIL CODE
 Article 2359
       A pledge extends to the accessories of the debt unless otherwise agreed.
 Article 2360
       Where a pledge  attaches to an account, the pledged debt must be understood as being the credit balance,
 provisional or final, on the day of the enforcement of the security with the reservation of the regularization of the current
 transactions, following the rules on enforcement proceedings.
       With the same reservation, in case of the opening against the pledgor of [insolvency proceedings] or of proceedings
 for the treatment of situations of over-running into debts of private persons, the rights of the pledgee creditor attaches on
 the balance of the account on the date of the jugement d'ouverture.
 Article 2361
       The pledge of a debt, actual or future, takes effect as between the parties and is enforceable against third parties as
 from the date of the instrument.
 Article 2362
       In order to be enforceable against the debtor of the pledged debt, the pledge of the debt must be notified to him or
 he must intervene in the instrument.
       Failing which, the pledgor alone duly receives payment of the debt.
 Article 2363
       After notice, the pledged creditor alone duly receives payment of the pledged debt in capital as well as in interest.

       Otherwise, the pledgee creditor shall keep them as security on an account open in an institution entitled to receive
 them on condition to return them if the secured obligation is performed. In case of default of the debtor of the pledged
 debt and eight days after a formal requisition remained ineffective, the creditor shall allocate the funds to the repayment
 of his debt to the extent of unpaid sums.
 Article 2365
       In case of default of his debtor, a pledgee creditor may have assigned to him, by the judge or in the way provided
 for in the agreement, the pledged debt as well as all the rights which attach to it.
       He may also wait till the debt becomes due.
 Article 2366
       Where a sum in excess of the secured debt is paid to the pledgee creditor, the latter owes the difference to the

 Article 2367
 Articles 2367 to 2372
       Ownership of a property may be retained as security through a clause of retention of title which stays the

 Article 2369
       The reserved  title of a fungible may, up to the amount of the debt remaining due, attach to property of same nature
 and quality detained by the debtor or on his behalf.

 to dispose thereof.
       The value of the resumed property shall be appropriated, for payment, on the balance of the secured debt.
       Where the value of the resumed property exceeds the amount of the secured debt still due, the creditor owes to the
 debtor a sum equal to the difference.
 Article 2372
       The right of ownership burdens the debtor's debt with respect to a subpurchaser or to the indemnity under an
 insurance policy which is subrogated to the property.

                                Of Special Prior Charges

 other works whatsoever, provided nevertheless that a memorandum has been previously drawn up by an expert
 appointed ex officio by the tribunal de grande instance  in whose territory the buildings are situated, for the purpose of
 establishing an inventory of the premises with respect to the works which the owner claims he intends to perform, and
 that the works, within six months at the most after their completion, have been accepted by an expert also appointed ex
 officio;
       But the amount of the prior charge may not exceed the values established by the second memorandum, and it shall
 be reduced to the increase in value which exists at the time of the transfer of the immovable and resulting from the
 works which have been done thereon;

 which they hold under Article 878;
       7° Prospective owners by virtue of a contract of lease with option to sell* regulated by Act no 84-595 of 12 July 1984
 defining lease with option to sell immovables on the immovable which is the subject matter of the contract, for the
 warranty of the rights which they hold under that contract. [ex Art. 2103]

 period allowed by Articles 2379, 2381 and 2383 for requiring the registration of a prior charge, may not prejudice
 creditors who have a prior debt.
       All preferential debts subject to the formality of registration, with respect to which the requisites above laid down in

 ranks, with regard to third parties, only from the time of the registration. [ex Art. 2113]

 Article 2389
       A creditor shall collect the revenue of the immovable allocated as security, on the condition that he appropriates it
 annually to the interest, if any is due to him, and then to the capital of the debt.
       He is bound, on pain of forfeiture, to provide for the preservation and maintenance of the immovable and may use
 the fruit collected for that purpose before appropriating it on the debt. He may, at any time, discharge himself from that
 obligation by restoring the property to his owner.

 Article 2392
       The rights of a creditor by way of antichresis are extinguished in particular:
       1° Through the extinguishment of the principal obligation;

       It follows them, in whatever hands they may pass. [ex Art. 2114]
 Article 2394
       A mortgage exists only in the instances and according to the forms authorized by law. [ex Art. 2115]

 Article 2400
 Articles 2400 to 2401
       Independently of statutory mortgages resulting from other Codes or from particular statutes, the rights and  debts to
 which a statutory mortgage is granted are:
       1° Those of one spouse, on the property of the other;
       2° Those of minors or adults in guardianship, on the property of a guardian or statutory administrator;
       3° Those of the State, of departments, of communes and of public institutions, on the property of collectors and
 accounting administrators;
       4° Those of a legatee, on the property of the succession, under Article 1017;
       5° Those stated in Article 2331, 2°, 3°, 5°, 6°, 7° and 8°. [ex Art. 2121]
 Article 2401
       With reservation both of the exceptions resulting from this Code, from other Codes or from particulars statutes and
 of the right of the debtor to avail himself of the provisions of Articles 2444 and following, a creditor benefiting from a
 statutory mortgage may register his right on all the immovables which currently belong to his debtor, subject to his
 complying with the provisions of Article 2426.
       Under the same reservations, he may have complementary registrations made respecting the immovables
 subsequently entered into the patrimony of his debtor. [ex Art. 2122]

                                        Of Particular Rules for the Statutory Mortgage of Spouses
 Article 2402
 Articles 2402 to 2408
       Where spouses have stipulated participation in acquisitions, the clause, except for agreement to the contrary, vests
 both by operation of law with the faculty to register a statutory mortgage to secure the debt in participation.
       Registration may be made before dissolution of the matrimonial regime; but it has effect only from that dissolution
 and provided that the immovables burdened exist at this date in the patrimony of the debtor spouse.
       In case of anticipated liquidation, a registration prior to the request has effect as from the day of the latter, a
 subsequent registration having effect only as from its date as stated in Article 2425.
       A registration may also be made within the year which follows the dissolution of the matrimonial regime; it then
 takes effect as from its date. [ex Art. 2136]
 Article 2403
       Outside the case of participation in acquisitions, a statutory mortgage may be registered only by intervention of the
 court, as explained in this Article and the following one.
       Where one of the spouses institutes a claim for the purpose of establishing a debt against his or her spouse or the
 heirs of the latter, he or she may, from the lodging of the claim, require a provisional registration of his or her statutory
 mortgage, by showing the original of the summons served, as well as a certificate from the clerk which attests that the
 matter has been referred to the court. The same right exists in case of counter-claim, upon showing of a copy of the
 pleadings.
       A registration is valid for three years and renewable. It is subject to the rules of  Chapters IV and following of this
 Title.
       Where the claim is entertained, the decision shall be mentioned, at the suit of the plaintiff spouse, in the margin of
 the provisional registration, on pain of nullity of that registration, within a month after the day when it became final. It
 constitutes the instrument of title for a final registration which takes the place of the provisional registration and which
 ranks at the date of the latter. Where the amount of the capital of the debt allowed and of its accessories exceeds the
 sum which the provisional registration secures, the excess may be maintained only by a registration made in
 accordance with the provisions of Article 2428 and taking effect from its date, as stated in Article 2425.
       Where the claim is dismissed in full, the court, on request of the defendant spouse, shall order the striking off of the
 provisional registration. [ex Art. 2137]
 Article 2404
       Likewise, where, during the marriage, there is occasion to transfer from one spouse to the other the administration
 of certain property, in accordance with Article 1426 or Article 1429, the court, either in the very judgment which orders
 the transfer, or in a subsequent judgment, may decide that a registration of the statutory mortgage shall be made
 respecting the immovables of the spouse who will have the responsibility of administering it. If so, it shall fix the sum for
 which registration will be made and designate the immovables which will be burdened with it. If not, it may nevertheless
 decide that the registration of a mortgage will be replaced by establishing a pawn, of which it itself shall determine the
 terms.
       Where, later on, new circumstances seem to require it, the court may always decide, by judgment, that either a first
 registration or complementary registrations shall be made or that a pawn shall be established.
       The registrations provided for by this Article shall be made and renewed at the request of the government
 procurator's office. [ex Art. 2138]

CIVIL CODE
 Article 2405
       Where a statutory mortgage has been registered under Articles 2402 or 2403, and unless an express clause of the
 ante-nuptial agreement prohibits it, the spouse who profits by the registration may agree, to the benefit of the other
 spouse's creditors or of his or her own creditors, to an assignment of his or her rank or to a subrogation to the rights
 resulting from his or her registration.
       It shall be the same as to a statutory mortgage or, possibly, a judicial mortgage securing periodical payments
 ordered, or liable to be ordered to a spouse, for himself or herself or for the children.
       Where the spouse who profits by the registration, by refusing to agree to an assignment of rank or to a subrogation,
 prevents the other spouse from creating a mortgage which the interest of the family would require or where he or she is
 unable to express his or her intention, the judges may authorize that assignment of rank or that subrogation subject to
 the conditions which they deem necessary for the protection of the rights of the spouse concerned. They have the same
 powers where the ante-nuptial agreement contains the clause referred to in the first paragraph. [ex Art. 2139]
 Article 2406
       Where a mortgage has been registered under Article 2404, an assignment of rank or a subrogation may result, for
 the duration of the transfer of administration, only from a judgment of the court which has ordered that transfer.
       As soon as the transfer of administration comes to an end, an assignment of rank or a subrogation may be made in
 the way provided for in Article 2405. [ex Art. 2140]
 Article 2407
       Judgments given under the two preceding Articles shall be handed down in the forms regulated by the Code of Civil
 Procedure.
       Subject to the provisions of Article 2403, a statutory mortgage of spouses is subject, as to renewal of registrations,
 to the rules of Article 2434. [ex Art. 2141]
 Article 2408
       The provisions of Articles 2402 to 2407 shall be made known to spouses or future spouses in the way provided for
 by a decree. [ex Art. 2142]

 Guardianship
 Article 2409
 Articles 2409 to 2411
       At the opening of any guardianship, the family council, after  hearing the guardian, shall decide whether a
 registration must be required on the immovables of the guardian. If so, it shall fix the sum for which the registration will
 be made and designate the immovables which will be burdened with it. If not, it may nevertheless decide that the
 registration of a mortgage will be replaced by the establishing of a pawn, of which it itself shall determine the terms.
       In the course of the guardianship, the family council may always order, where the interests of the minor or of the
 adult in guardianship seem to require it, that either a first registration or complementary registrations will be made or that
 a pawn will be established.
       In the cases where statutory administration takes place under Article 389, the judge of guardianships, who gives
 judgment either of his own motion or on the request of a relative by blood or by marriage or of the government
 procurator's office, may likewise decide that a registration will be made on the immovables of the statutory administrator,
 or that the latter must establish a pawn.
       The registrations provided for by this Article shall be made at the request of the clerk of the judge of guardianships,
 and the costs shall be charged to the account of the guardianship.  [ex Art. 2143]
 Article 2410
       A ward, after his or her coming of age or emancipation, or an adult in guardianship, after withdrawing of the
 guardianship of adults, may require the registration of his or her statutory mortgage or a complementary registration,
 within a period of one year.
       This right may, furthermore, be exercised by the heirs of the ward or of the adult in guardianship within the same
 period, and in case of death of the person under a disability before the ending of the guardianship or the withdrawing of
 the guardianship of adults, within the year of the death.  [ex Art. 2144]
 Article 2411
       During the minority and the guardianship of adults, a registration made by virtue of Article 2409 shall be renewed by
 the clerk of the arrondissement, in accordance with Article 2434 of the Civil Code.   [ex Art. 2145]

 Article 2412
 Article 2412
       A judicial mortgage results from adversary or default judgments, final or provisional, in favour of the one who has
 obtained them.
       It also results from arbitral awards provided with an enforcement order, as well as from judicial decisions handed
 down in a foreign country and whose execution has been authorized by a French court.
       With reservation of the right of the debtor to avail himself, either pending suit, or at any other time, of the provisions

 of Articles 2444 and following, a creditor who benefits by a judicial mortgage may register his right respecting all the
 immovables currently belonging to his debtor, subject to his complying with the provisions of Article 2426. He may,
 under the same reservations, have complementary registrations made respecting the immovables subsequently entered
 into the patrimony of his debtor.

                                SECTION IV
                                Of Conventional Mortgages
 Articles 2413 to 2424
       Conventional mortgages may be granted only by those who have the capacity of conveying the immovables which
 they burden with them. [ex Art. 2124]
 Article 2414
       Those who on an immovable have only a right suspended by a condition, or avoidable in certain cases, or subject to
 rescission, may only grant a mortgage subject to the same conditions or to the same rescission
       The mortgage of an undivided immovable retains its effect whatever the result of the partition may be where it has
 been granted by all the co-owners. Otherwise, it retains its effect only in so ar as the co-owner who has granted it is, at
 the time of the partition, apportioned with that or those undivided immovables or, when the immovable is sold by auction
 to a third party, if that co-owner is apportioned with the proceeds of the sale.
       The mortgage of a share in one or several undivided immovables retains its effect only in so far as the co-owner
 who has granted it is, at the time of the partition, apportioned with that or those undivided immovables; then, it retains it
 in the whole extent of that apportionment without being limited to the share who belonged to the co-owner who has
 granted it; when the immovable is sold by auction to a third party, it retains also it where that co-owner is apportioned
 with the proceeds of the sale.
 Article 2415
       The property of minors, of adults in guardianship and of absentees, so long as its possession is conferred only
 temporarily, may be mortgaged only for the causes and in the forms established by law or by virtue of a judgment. [ex
 Art. 2126]
 Article 2416
       A conventional mortgage may only be granted by an instrument drawn up in authentic form. [ex Art. 2127]
 Article 2417
       Contracts entered into in foreign countries may not establish a mortgage on immovables in France, unless there are
 provisions contrary to this principle in political statutes or in treaties. [ex Art. 2128]
 Article 2418
       The granting of a conventional mortgage is valid only where the authentic constitutive title of the debt or a
 subsequent authentic instrument declares in specific terms the nature and the location of each one of the immovables
 on which the mortgage is granted, as stated in Article 2426 below. [ex Art. 2129]
 Article 2419
       As a rule, a mortgage may be granted only on existing immovables.
 Article 2420
       By exception to the preceding article, a mortgage may be granted on immovables  to come in the following
 circumstances and subject to the following conditions:
       1° He who does not possess existing and unencumbered immovables or who does not possess sufficient quantity of
 them  to secure the debt may agree that each one which he may subsequently acquire be allocated to the payment of
 the latter as the acquisitions proceed;
       2° He whose existing immovable burdened with a mortgage has perished or suffered deteriorations so that it has
 become insufficient for the security of the debt may do so likewise, without prejudice to the right of the creditor to enforce
 at once his reimbursement;
       3° He who possesses an existing right which allows him to build for his benefit on another's tenement may mortgage
 the buildings whose erection is initiated or merely planned; in case of destruction of the latter, the mortgage burdens as
 of right new buildings erected on the same place.
 Article 2421
       A mortgage may be granted for security of one or several debts, existing or to come. Where they are to come they
 must be determined.
       Their grounds shall be determined in the instrument.
 Article 2422
       A mortgage may be subsequently allocated to secure debts other than those mentioned in the constitutive
 instrument provided that the latter lays so down expressly.
       The mortgagor may then offer it as security, up to the sum provided for in the constitutive instrument and specified
 in Article 2423, not only to the original creditor, but also to a new creditor although the first one has not been paid.
       The agreement for the coverage of new debts which he concludes, either with the original creditor or with the new

 creditor, shall be drawn up in notarial form.
       Public notice thereof shall be given, with the formalities laid down in Article 2430, on pain of its being ineffective
 against third parties.
       Its date of registration fixes, as between them, the rank of the creditors registered on a  mortgage which provides for
 the coverage of future debts.
       The provisions of this Article are of public policy and any clause contrary to them shall be deemed not written.
 Article 2423
       A mortgage is always granted, as regards the capital, up to a fixed sum which the notarial instrument shall specify
 on pain of annulment. Where appropriate, the parties shall estimate for that purpose the annuities, benefits and
 undetermined, contingent or conditional rights. Where the debt is subject to an index-linking clause, the guarantee
 extends to the revalued debt, provided the instrument so specifies.
       A mortgage extends by operation of the law to interest and other accessories.
       Where it is granted for security of one or several debts to come and for an undetermined duration, the mortgagor
 may at any time terminate it subject to his giving a three month's notice. Once terminated, it is still extant only for
 security of pre-existing claims.
 Article 2424
       A mortgage is transferred with the secured debt by operation of the law. A mortgagee  may subrogate an other
 creditor to a mortgage and retain his debt.
       He may also by a ranking agreement transfer his rank of registration to a third party of a subsequent rank, with
 whom he changes places.
                                SECTION V
                                Of the Rank of Mortgages
 Article 2425
 Article 2425
       As between creditors, a mortgage, either statutory, or judicial, or conventional, ranks only from the day of the
 registration made by the creditor at the land registry, in the form and manner prescribed by law.
       Where several registrations are required on the same day as to the same immovable, that which is required by
 virtue of the instrument of title bearing the remotest date shall be deemed of prior rank, whatever the order resulting from
 the register provided for in Article 2453 may be.
       However, the registrations of separations of patrimony provided for by Article 2283, in the case referred to in Article
 2386, paragraph 2, as well as those of the statutory mortgages provided for in Article 2400, 1°, 2° and 3°, shall be
 deemed of a rank prior to the one of any registration of judicial or conventional mortgages made on the same day.
       Where several registrations are made on the same day as to the same immovable, either by virtue of instruments of
 title provided for in the second paragraph but bearing the same date, or for the benefit of requiring parties vested with
 the prior charge or the mortgages referred to in the third paragraph, the registrations rank equally whatever the order of
 the above mentioned register may be.
       The registration of an interim protective judicial mortgage shall be deemed of an earlier rank than that conferred to
 an agreement for the coverage of new debts where the registration of the aforesaid agreement is subsequent to the
 registration of the interim protective judicial mortgage.
       The order of priority between creditors having a prior charge or mortgage and holders of warrants, insofar as the
 latter are secured on property deemed immovable, is determined by the dates on which the respective instruments have
 been given public notice, the recording of warrants remaining subject to the special statutes which regulate them. [ex

                                Of the Mode of Registration of Prior Charges and Mortgages
 Article 2426
       Shall be registered at the land registry of the location of the property:
       1° Prior charges over immovables, subject to the sole exceptions referred to in Article 2378;
       2° Statutory, judicial or conventional mortgages.
 Articles 2426 to 2457
 Articles 2426 to 2439
       A registration which may never be made by the registrar of his own motion, may take place only for a sum and for
 immovables which are determined, subject to the conditions laid down in Article 2428.
       In any case, the immovables respecting to which a registration is required must be individually designated, with
 indication of the commune where they are situated, exclusive of any general designation, even limited to a given
 territorial area. [ex Art. 2146]
 Article 2427
       Creditors who have a prior charge or mortgage may not profitably make registration respecting to the preceding
 owner, from the recording of the transfer made for the benefit of a third party. Notwithstanding that recording, a seller, a
 lender of funds for acquisition and a coparcener may profitably register, within the periods provided for in Articles 2379
 and 2381, the prior charges which Article 2374 confers upon them.
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 250/268
CIVIL CODE
       A registration produces no effect between the creditors of a succession where it has been made by one of them
 only after the death, in case the succession is accepted only under benefit of inventory or is declared vacant. However,
 the prior charges granted to a seller, a lender of funds for an acquisition, a coparcener, as well as to the creditors and
 legatees of the deceased, may be registered within the periods provided for in Articles 2379, 2381 and 2383,
 notwithstanding an acceptance under benefit or the vacancy of the succession.
       In case of seizure of immovables, of [insolvency proceedings] or of proceedings in view of a judicial arrangement,
 the registration of prior charges and mortgages produces the effects regulated by the provisions of the Code of Civil
 Procedure and by those of Titles II, III or IV of Book VI of the Commercial Code. [ex Art. 2147]
       In the départements of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin and Moselle, in case of enforcement over an immovable, the
 registration of prior charges and mortgages produces the effects regulated by the provisions of the Act of 1 June 1924.
 Article 2428
       The registration of prior charges and mortgages shall be made by the land registrar following the filing of two
 schedules dated, signed and certified to be corresponding to each other by the signatory of the certificate of identity
 provided for in paragraph 13 of this Article; a decree in Conseil d'Etat shall determine the requirements as to form which
 the schedule designed to be kept in the land registry must comply with. In the case where the registrant did not use a
 prescribed form, the registrar shall nevertheless accept the deposit, subject to the provisions of the penultimate
 paragraph of this Article.
       However, in order to have judicial mortgages or securities registered, a creditor shall present, either himself or
 through a third party, to the land registrar:
       1° The original, an authentic office copy or a literal extract from the judicial decision giving rise to the mortgage,
 where the latter results from the provisions of Article 2412;
       2° The authorization of the judge, the judicial decision or the instrument of title in matters of judicial provisional
 securities.
       Each of the schedules shall contain exclusively, on pain of rejection of the formality:
       1° The designation of the creditor, of the debtor or of the owner, where the debtor is not the owner of the burdened
 immovable, in accordance with paragraph 1 of Articles 5 and 6 of the Decree of 4 January 1955;
       2° The election of domicile, by the creditor, in any place situated in France, in overseas departments or in the
 territorial authorities of Saint-Pierre -et-Miquelon;
       3° The indication of the date and nature of the instrument of title giving rise to the security or of the instrument of title
 creating the debt as well as the origin of the obligation secured by the prior charge or thee mortgage and, if there is
 occasion, the actual indication of the clause of coverage of new debts provided for in Article 2422. Where a notarial
 instrument is concerned, the name and residence of the draftsman shall be specified. As to the registrations required in
 compliance with the provisions referred to in Articles 2383 and 2400, 1° to 3°, the schedules shall set out the origin and
 nature of the debt;
       4° The indication of the capital of the debt, of its accessories and of the normal date of maturity; in any case, the
 applicant shall appraise the annuities, benefits and undetermined, contingent and conditional rights, without prejudice to
 the application of Articles 2444 and 2445 for the benefit of the debtor; and where the rights are contingent or conditional,
 he shall summarily indicate the event or the condition upon which the existence of the debt depends. In the cases where
 the debt is coupled with an index-linking clause, the registration shall mention the original amount of the debt as well as
 the index-linking clause. Where the amount of the debt is not denominated in euros, it shall be immediately followed by
 its exchange value in euros determined according to the latest rate of exchange  known at the date of the title creating
 the security or the debt;
       5° The designation, in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 7 of the Decree of 4 January 1955, of each 
immovable respecting to which a registration is required;
       6° The indication of the date, volume and number under which the title of ownership of the debtor (or of the owner,
 where the debtor is not the owner of the immovables burdened) was registered, when that title is subsequent to 1
 January 1956;
       7° The certification that the amount of the capital of the secured debt mentioned in the schedule is not greater than
 that shown in the title creating the security or the debt.
       A schedule designed to be kept in the land registry shall contain, in addition, a mention of certification of the identity
 of the parties, prescribed by Articles 5 and 6 of the Decree of 4 January 1955.
       A filing shall be refused:
       1° Failing the presentation of the title creating the security as to mortgages and judicial securities;
       2° Failing the mention referred to in paragraph 13, or where the immovables are not individually designated, with
 indication of the commune* where they are situated.
       Where the registrar, after having accepted the filing, notices the omission of one of the mentions prescribed by this
 Article, or a discrepancy between, on the one hand, the statements relating to the identity of the parties or to the
 designation of the immovables contained in the schedule, and, on the other hand, those same statements contained in
 schedules or titles already recorded since 1 January 1956, the formality shall be rejected, unless the applicant
 regularizes the schedule or produces the proof which establishes its accuracy, in which cases, the formality ranks on the
 date of the filing of the schedule noted in the register of filings.
       A formality shall also be rejected where the schedules include an amount of secured debt greater than that which
 appears in the title as regards mortgaged and judicial securities, as well as in the case referred to in the first paragraph
 of this Article, where the applicant does not substitute a new schedule on a prescribed form to the schedule irregular as

 to form.
       The decree above provided for shall determine the details of a refusal of a filing or of a rejection of a formality. [ex
 Art. 2148 amended]
 Article 2429
       For the sake of their registration, prior charges and mortgages bearing on shares depending on a building subject to
 the status of co-ownership shall be deemed not to burden the portions of the common parts included in those shares.
       Nevertheless, the registered creditors shall enforce their rights on the said portion taken in its consistence at the
 time of the transfer whose proceeds are the subject matter of the division; that portion shall be deemed burdened with
 the same securities as the individual shares and with those securities only. [ex Art. 2148-1]
 Article 2430
       Shall be recorded by the registrar, under the form of mentions in the margin of the existing registrations, the
 subrogations to prior charges and mortgages, withdrawals, reductions, assignments of priority and transfers which have
 been granted, extensions of time, changes of domicile and, as a general rule, any modifications, in particular as to the
 person of the creditor who benefits by the registration, which do not have the effect of worsening the condition of the
 debtor.
       It shall be the same as to gratuitous transfers by inter vivos or testamentary instrument, on condition of restitution,
 bearing on debts secured by prior claims or mortgages.
       Shall be recorded under the same form the agreements which must be so under Article 2422.
       The instruments and judicial decisions recording those different agreements or transfers and the copies, extracts, or
 office copies filed at the land registry for the purpose of execution of the mentions shall contain the designation of the
 parties in accordance with the first paragraph of Articles 5 and 6 of the Decree of 4 January 1955. That designation need
 not be certified.
       Furthermore, in case a mentioned modification bears only on part of the immovables burdened, the said
 immovables shall be individually designated, on pain of refusal of the filing. [ex Art. 2149 amended]
 Article 2431
       The registrar shall mention the filing of the schedules on the register prescribed by Article 2453 hereinafter, and
 shall return to the applicant both the instrument of title or the office copy of the same, and one of the schedules at the
 bottom of which he shall mention the date of the filing, the volume and the number under which the schedule intended
 for the archives has been filed.
       The date of the registration is determined by the mention entered into the register of filings.
       The schedules intended for the archives shall be bound without being removed through the good offices of and at
 the expense of the registrars.  [ex Art. 2150]
 Article 2432
       A creditor with a prior charge whose title has been registered, or a mortgage creditor registered for a capital
 producing interest and arrears, has the right to be marshalled, for three years only, on the same rank as for his principal,
 without prejudice to the special registrations to be made, importing mortgage from their date, for the interest and arrears
 other than those preserved by the original registration.
       However, a creditor has the right to be marshalled for the whole interest, on the same rank as his principal, where
 the mortgage has been granted as security for the  loan for life defined by Article L. 314-1 of the Consumer Code. [ex
 Art. 2151]
 Article 2433
       A person who has required a registration as well as his representatives or assigns under an authentic instrument
 are entitled to change at the land registry the domicile elected by him in that registration, provided they choose and
 designate a new one situated in metropolitan France, in overseas départments or in the territorial authority of
 Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon.  [ex Art. 2152]
 Article 2434
       Registration preserves a prior charge or a mortgage up to the date which the creditor shall fix complying with the
 following provisions:
       Where the principal of a secured obligation must be paid at one or several due dates, the extreme effective date of
 a registration made before the due date or the last due date provided for is, at most, two years after that due date
 without allowing however the duration of the registration to exceed fifty years.
       Where the due date or the last due date is undetermined, in particular in the case provided for by Article L. 314-1 of
 the Consumer Code, or where a mortgage is coupled with a clause of coverage of new debts provided for in Article
 2422, the duration of the registration is at most fifty years after the day of the formality.
       Where the due date or the last due date is prior to or concomitant with the registration, the duration of the
 registration is at most ten years after the day of the formality.
       Where a security secures several debts and the latter are such that several of the three preceding paragraphs
 apply, the creditor may require either, for each of them, distinct registrations, or a single registration for the whole up to
 the remotest date.
       It shall be the same where, the first of those paragraphs alone being applicable, the different debts do not involve
 the same due dates or last due dates.  [ex Art. 2154 amended]

 Article 2435
       A registration ceases to produce effect where it has not been renewed at the latest at the date referred to in the first
 paragraph of Article 2434.
       Each renewal is required up to a determined date. That date shall be fixed as stated in Article 2434 by
 distinguishing according to whether the due date or the last due date, even where it results from an extension of time, is
 determined or not and whether it is subsequent or not to the day of the renewal.
       Renewal is compulsory, in case the registration has produced its statutory effect, in particular, in case of sale of the
 immovable burdened, until payment or deposit of the proceeds. [ex Art. 2154-1]
 Article 2436
       Where one of the periods referred to in Articles 2434 and 2435 has not been complied with, a registration does not
 have any effect beyond the date of the expiry of that period. [ex Art. 2154-2 amended]
 Article 2437
       Where a provisional registration of the statutory mortgage of spouses or of a judicial mortgage has been made, the
 provisions of Articles 2434 to 2436 shall apply to the final registration and to its renewal. The date from which the
 periods shall begin to run is that of the final registration or of its renewal. [ex Art. 2154-3]
 Article 2438
       Unless otherwise stipulated, the expenses of the registrations shall be advanced by the registrant and charged to
 the debtor, and the expenses of the recording of the instrument of sale which a seller may require with a view to the
 registration of his prior charge within the prescribed time, shall be charged to the buyer. [ex Art. 2155]
 Article 2439
       The claims to which registrations may give rise against creditors shall be brought before the court having
 jurisdiction, by summons served upon their persons, or at the last of the domiciles elected by them on the schedules of
 registration, even in case of death, either of the creditors, or of those at whose residence they have elected domicile. [ex

 Article 2440
 Articles 2440 to 2457
 Articles 2440 to 2445
       Registrations are cancelled by the consent of the parties concerned and having capacity therefor, or by virtue of a
 judgment not subject to appeal or having become res judicata. [ex Art. 2157]
       Cancellation  is incumbent to a creditor who did not initiate a registration under the form of a mention in the margin,
 provided for in Article 2422, paragraph 4.
 Article 2441
       In both cases, those who require cancellation shall file at the registrar's office the office copy of the authentic
 instrument containing the consent, or that of the judgment.
       No document in proof is required to support the office copy of the authentic instrument concerning the statements
 establishing the status, capacity and qualifications of the parties, where those statements are certified as accurate in the
 instrument by the notaire or the administrative authority.
       Where a cancellation concerns the registration of a conventional mortgage, it may be required by the filing at the
 registrar's office of an office copy of the notarial instrument certifying that the creditor, on demand of the debtor, agreed
 to that cancellation; the registrar's inspection shall restrict itself to the formal conformity of the instrument excluding its
 substantial validity. [ex Art. 2158 amended]
 Article 2442
       A cancellation without consent shall be applied for before the court in whose territory the registration was made,
 unless that registration was made to secure a contingent or undetermined order, on whose enforcement or
 determination the debtor and the alleged creditor are in litigation or are to be judged in another court; in which case the
 claim for cancellation  shall be brought or remitted there.
       However, the agreement entered into by the creditor and the debtor to bring a claim, in case of controversy, before
 a court which they have designated, shall be enforced between them.  [ex Art. 2159]
 Article 2443
       Cancellation shall be ordered by the courts, where a registration was made without being based on legislation or on
 a title, or where it was made by virtue of a title either irregular or extinguished or satisfied, or where the rights of prior
 charge or of mortgage are wiped out by legal remedies. [ex Art. 2160]
 Article 2444
       Where the registrations made under Articles 2400 and 2401 are excessive, the debtor may apply for their reduction
 by complying with the rules of jurisdiction established by Article 2442.
       Are deemed excessive the registrations which burden several immovables where the value of a single one or of
 some of them exceeds a sum equal to double of the amount of the debts in capital and statutory accessories, increased
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 253/268
CIVIL CODE
 by one-third of that amount. [ex Art. 2161]
 Article 2445
       May also be reduced as excessive the registrations made according to an appraisal made by the creditor of
 conditional, contingent or undetermined debts whose amount was not fixed by the agreement.
       In that case, the excess shall be appraised by the court according to the circumstances, probabilities and
 presumptions of fact, in such a manner as to conciliate the rights of the creditor with the interest of preserving credit to
 the debtor, without prejudice to new registrations to be made with a mortgage from the day of their date, where events
 have raised the undetermined debts to a larger sum. [ex Art. 2162]

                                        Particular Provisions relating to Mortgages of Spouses and of
 Persons in Guardianship
 Article 2446
 Articles 2446 to 2448
       Where a statutory mortgage has been registered under Articles 2402 or 2403, and except for an express clause of
 the ante-nuptial agreement which forbids it, the spouse who profits by the registration may give a total or partial
 withdrawal of it.
       It shall be the same as to a statutory mortgage, or possibly a judicial mortgage securing periodical payments
 ordered, or liable to be ordered  to a spouse, for himself or herself or for the children.
       Where the spouse who profits by the registration, by refusing to reduce the mortgage or to give a withdrawal of it,
 prevents the other spouse from creating a mortgage or making a transfer which the interest of the family would require
 or where he or she is unable to express his or her intention, the judges may authorize that reduction or withdrawal
 subject to the conditions which they deem necessary for the protection of the rights of the spouse concerned. They have
 the same powers where the ante-nuptial agreement contains the clause referred to in the first paragraph.
       Where a mortgage has been registered under Article 2404, the registration may, for the duration of the transfer of
 administration, be cancelled or reduced only by virtue of a judgment of the court which has ordered that transfer.
       As soon as the transfer of administration comes to an end, a cancellation or reduction may be made in the way
 provided for in paragraphs 1 and 3 above. [ex Art. 2163]
 Article 2447
       Where the value of the immovables on which the mortgage of a minor or of an adult in guardianship has been
 registered notably exceeds what is necessary to secure the management of the guardian, the latter may request the
 family council to reduce the registration to the immovables which are sufficient.
       He may likewise request it to reduce the appraisal made of his obligations towards the ward.
       In the same cases, where a registration has been made on his immovables under Article 2409, a statutory
 administrator may request the judge of guardianships to reduce it, either as to the immovables burdened, or as to the
 sums secured.
       Furthermore, if there is occasion, a guardian and a statutory administrator may, subject to the same conditions,
 request a total withdrawal of the mortgage.
       The total or partial cancellation of the mortgage shall be made upon presentation of an instrument of withdrawal
 signed by a member of the family council having received delegation to that effect, as to the immovables of a guardian,
 and upon presentation of a decision of the judge of guardianships, as to the immovables of a statutory administrator. [ex
 Art. 2164]
 Article 2448
       Judgments on request of a spouse, a guardian or a statutory administrator in the cases provided for in the
 preceding Articles shall be handed down in the forms regulated in the Code of Civil Procedure.
       Where a court orders the reduction of a mortgage to certain immovables, the registrations made on all the others
 shall be cancelled.  [ex Art. 2165]

 Article 2449
 Articles 2449 to 2457
       Land registrars are compelled to deliver to all those who so require a copy or extract of the documents, other than
 the schedules of registration, filed at their registry within the limit of fifty years preceding that of the demand, and a copy
 or extract of the subsisting registrations, or a certificate to the effect that there exists no document or registration coming
 within the scope of the request.
       They are also compelled to deliver upon demand, within a period of ten days, copies of or extracts from the
 land-book, or a certificate to the effect that there exists no card coming within the scope of the request. [ex Art. 2196]
 Article 2450
       They are liable for the loss resulting:
       1° From failure to record instruments and judicial decisions filed at their registries, and required registrations, any
 time that failure to record does not result from a decision of refusal or of rejection;
       2° From the omission, in the certificates which they deliver, of one or several of the existing registrations, unless, in
 this latter case, the error comes from insufficient or inaccurate designations which may not be ascribed to them. [ex Art.

 Article 2451
       Where a registrar, delivering a certificate to the new holder of a right referred to in Article 2476, omits a registration
 of a prior charge or mortgage, the right remains in the hands of the new holder free from the undisclosed prior charge or
 mortgage, provided the delivery of the certificate has been required by the party concerned as a consequence of the
 recording of his title. Without prejudice to his possible remedy against the registrar, the creditor who benefits by the
 omitted registration does not lose the right to avail himself of the rank which that registration confers on him so long as
 the price has not been paid by the purchaser or as intervention in the ranking initiated between the other creditors is
 permitted. [ex Art. 2198]
 Article 2452
       Except in the cases where they are entitled to refuse a filing or to reject a formality, in accordance with the
 provisions of statutes and regulations relating to land registration, registrars may not refuse or delay the fulfilment of a
 formality or the delivery of documents duly required, on pain of damages to the parties; for that purpose, memoranda of
 refusals or delays shall, at the suit of the requiring party, be forthwith drawn up, either by a judge of the arrondissement,
 or by a court usher of the court, or by another bailiff or a notaire with the assistance of two witnesses. [ex Art. 2199]
 Article 2453
       Registrars are compelled to have a register in which they shall enter, day by day and in numerical order, the filings
 made with them of instruments, judicial decisions, schedules and, generally, of documents filed for the purpose of the
 execution of a formality of registration.
       They may fulfil the formalities only at the date and in the order of the filings made with them.
       Each year a duplicating of the registers closed during the preceding year shall be deposited without cost at the
 clerk's office of a tribunal de grande instance  or of a tribunal d'instance situated in an arrondissement different from the
 one where the registrar resides.
       The court in whose clerk's office the duplicating will be deposited shall be designated by an order of the Minister of
 Justice.
       A decree shall determine the details of application of this Article and, in particular, the technical processes which
 may be used for the making of the duplicating to be deposited at the clerk's office. [ex Art. 2200]
 Article 2454
       A register kept in compliance with the preceding Article shall be numbered and initialled upon each page, by first
 and last, by the juge d'instance in whose territory the registry is established. It shall be closed every day.
       Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, a written data-processing document may take the place of a register; in
 that case, it shall be identified, numbered and dated as soon as it is established by wholly trustworthy forms of proof. [ex
 Art. 2201]
 Article 2455
       In performing their duties, registrars are compelled to comply with all the provisions of this Chapter, on pain of a fine
 of 30 to 300 € for the first infringement, and of dismissal for the second; without prejudice to damages to the parties,
 which shall be paid before the fine. [ex Art. 2202]
 Article 2456
       The mentions of the filings shall be made on the register whose keeping is prescribed by Article 2453, following
 each other, without any blank or interlineations, on pain, against the registrar, of a fine of 60 to 600 €, and of damages to
 the parties, also payable by priority over the fine. [ex Art. 2203]
 Article 2457
       In the land registries whose register is kept in accordance with the provisions of Article 2454, paragraph 2, there
 shall be delivered a certificate of the formalities accepted for filing and awaiting recording in the land card-index on the
 immovables individually designated in the request for information. A decree in Conseil d'Etat shall specify the contents of
 that certificate. [ex Art. 2203-1]

 Articles 2458 to 2460
       Unless he takes action to sell the mortgaged property under the terms provided for by the rules which apply to
 enforcement proceedings, to which a contract of mortgage may not derogate, a mortgagee may request the court to
 retain the immovable by way of satisfaction. However, that option is not open to him where the immovable is the main
 residence of the debtor.
 Article 2459
       It may be agreed  in a contract of mortgage that the creditor shall become owner of the mortgaged immovable.
 However, that clause is ineffective in regard to the immovable which is the main residence of the debtor.

 Article 2460
       In the circumstances referred to in the two preceding Articles, the immovable shall be appraised by an expert
 designated  by amicable agreement or judicially.
       Where its value exceeds the amount of the secured debt, the creditor owes the debtor a sum equal to the
 difference; where there exist other mortgagees, he shall deposit it.

 Article 2461
 Articles 2461 to 2474
       Creditors who have a prior charge or a mortgage registered on an immovable, follow it in whatever hands it may
 pass, in order to be marshalled and paid following the order of their debts or registrations. [ex Art. 2166]
 Article 2462
       Where a third party in possession does not comply with the formalities hereinafter established to free his property,
 he remains, by the sole effect of the registrations, liable as a possessor for all the mortgage debts and he has the benefit
 of the time limits and periods granted to the original debtor. [ex Art. 2167]
 Article 2463
       A third party in possession is bound, in the same case, either to pay all the interest and capital due, to whatever
 sum they may amount, or to relinquish unreservedly the mortgaged immovable. [ex Art. 2168]
 Article 2464
       Where a third party in possession fails to comply fully with one of these obligations, each mortgagee is entitled to
 have the immovable sold against him, thirty days after serving an order to pay on the original debtor, and demanding
 that the third party in possession pay the debt due or relinquish the inherited property. [ex Art. 2169]
 Article 2465
       Nevertheless, a third party in possession who is not personally liable for the debt, may object to the sale of the
 mortgaged property which has been transferred to him, where other immovables mortgaged for the same debt have
 remained in the possession of the principal debtor or debtors, and require their previous seizure and sale in the manner
 regulated in the Title Of Suretyship ; during these proceedings, the sale of the mortgaged property shall be postponed.
 [ex Art. 2170]
 Article 2466
       The defence of seizure and sale is not available against a creditor who benefits by a prior charge or who has a
 special mortgage on the immovable. [ex Art. 2171]
 Article 2467
       As to relinquishment by reason of a mortgage, it may be done by all third parties in possession who are not
 personally liable for the debt and who have the capacity to transfer. [ex Art. 2172]
 Article 2468
       It may be done even after the third party in possession has acknowledged the debt or where a judgment has been
 given against him in that capacity only: until a sale by auction, relinquishment does not prevent a third party in
 possession from taking back the immovable by paying the whole debt and the costs. [ex Art. 2173]
 Article 2469
       Relinquishment by reason of a mortgage is made at the clerk's office of the court of the situation of the property; and
 that court shall record it.
       On the petition of the most diligent party concerned, a curator shall be appointed for the immovable relinquished,
 against whom the sale of the immovable shall be conducted in the forms prescribed for forced sales. [ex Art. 2174]
 Article 2470
       Deteriorations resulting from the act or negligent conduct of a third party in possession, to the detriment of creditors
 benefiting by a mortgage  or a prior charge, give rise against him to a claim for compensation; but he recovers his
 upkeep and improvements only up to the additional value resulting from the improvement. [ex Art. 2175]
 Article 2471
       The fruits of a mortgaged immovable are owed by a third party in possession only from the day of the demand to
 pay or relinquish, and, where the proceedings instituted have been discontinued for three years, from the new demand
 which will be made. [ex Art. 2176]
 Article 2472
       Servitudes and rights in rem which the third party in possession had on the immovable before his possession, are
 revived after the relinquishment or after the sale by auction made against him.
       His personal creditors, after all those who are registered on the previous owners, shall enforce their mortgage on
 the property relinquished or auctioned, according to their rank. [ex Art. 2177]
 Article 2473
       A third party in possession who has paid the mortgage debt, or relinquished the immovable, or suffered the forced
 sale of that immovable has a remedy for warranty, as allowed by law, against the principal debtor. [ex Art. 2178]

 Article 2475
       Where, on the occasion of the sale of a mortgaged immovable, all the registered creditors agree with the debtor that
 the proceeds shall be allocated to the full or part satisfaction of their debts or of some of them, they shall exercise their
 right of preferential payment out of the proceeds and may assert it as against any assignee or any creditor attaching the
 debt of the proceeds.
       Through that payment, the immovable is redeemed from the right to follow it attaching to the mortgage.
       Failing an agreement such as provided for in paragraph 1, the formalities of redemption are proceeded to in
 accordance with the following Articles.
                                SECTION II

 Article 2476
 Articles 2476 to 2487
       Contracts which transfer the ownership of immovables or immovable rights in rem which third parties in possession
 wish to redeem from prior charges and mortgages shall be recorded in the land registry of the situation of the property,
 in accordance with the statutes and regulations relating to land registration. [ex Art. 2181]
 Article 2477
       The mere recording in the land registry of the conveyances does not redeem an immovable from mortgages and
 prior charges which burden it.
       A seller conveys to a purchaser only the ownership and the rights he himself had on the thing sold: he conveys
 them subject to the same prior charges and mortgages with which the thing sold was burdened. [ex Art. 2182]
 Article 2478
       Where a new owner wishes to protect himself against the effect of the proceedings authorized in Chapter V of this
 Title, he is bound, either before the proceedings, or within one month, at the latest, after the first demand which is made
 to him, to serve on the creditors, at the domiciles they have elected in their registrations, notice of:
       1° An extract of his title, containing only the date and character of the instrument, the name and precise designation
 of the seller or of the donor, the nature and situation of the thing sold or donated; and where a set of items of property is
 concerned, only the general designation of the domain and of the arrondissements  in which it is situated, the price and
 the costs forming part of the sale price, or the appraisal of the thing where it has been donated;
       2° An extract of the recording of the instrument of sale;
       3° A summary schedule of registrations showing the charges in rem which burden the immovable [ex Art. 2183
 amended]
 Article 2479
       The purchaser or the donee shall declare, in the same instrument, that he is ready to pay, forthwith, the mortgage
 debts and charges, only up to the amount of the price, or, where he received the immovable by gift, to the value he has
 declared without distinction between debts due or not due. [ex Art. 2184 amended]
 Article 2480
       Where the new owner has served that notice within the fixed period, any creditor whose title has been registered,
 may require the sale of the immovable by public auction, provided that:
       1° The request is served on the new owner within forty days, at the latest, of the notice served at his request;
       2° It contains undertaking of the requesting party to raise the price, or to have it raised, to one-tenth above the one
 stipulated in the contract, or declared by the new owner;
       3° The same notice is served within the same period on the previous owner, principal debtor;
       4° The original and the copies of these notices are signed by the requiring creditor, or by his agent with express
 authority, who, in that case, is obliged to give a copy of his power of attorney;
       5° He offers to give security up to the amount of the price and charges.
       All of which, on pain of annulment. [ex Art. 2185 amended]
 Article 2481
       Where the creditors have failed to require a sale by auction within the period and in the manner prescribed, the
 value of the immovable remains definitely fixed at the price stipulated in the contract, or declared by the new owner, who

 either of the creditor who has required it, or of the new owner.
       The party seeking execution shall state in the placards the price stipulated in the contract, or declared, and the
 additional sum to which the creditor has obliged himself to raise it or to have it raised. [ex Art. 2187]
 Article 2483
       The highest bidder is bound, beyond the auction price, to return to the dispossessed purchaser or donee the
 expenses and proper costs of his contract, those of the registration at the land registry, those of the notices and those
 incurred by him to have the resale made. [ex Art. 2188]
 Article 2484

 Article 2485

 Article 2486
       A purchaser who has become the final bidder has his remedy such as allowed by law against the seller, for the

 Article 2487
       In the case where the title of the new owner includes immovables and movables, or several immovables, some

 same price, or for distinct or separate prices, forming part of the same business or not, the price of each immovable
 subject to particular and separate registrations, shall be declared in the notice of the new owner, by itemizing the total
 price expressed in the title, if there is occasion.
       A creditor who outbids may in no case be compelled to extend his bid either over the movables, or over immovables
 other than those which are mortgaged for his debt and situated in the same arrondissement; but the new owner has a
 remedy against his predecessors in title for compensation for the loss which he may suffer, either from the division of the
 objects of his purchase, or from that of the business. [ex Art. 2192]
                        CHAPTER VII
                        Of the Extinguishment of Prior Charges and Mortgages
 Article 2488
       Prior charges and mortgages are extinguished :
 Article 2488
       1° By extinguishment of the principal obligation except for the case provided for in Article 2422;
       2° By the creditor's renunciation of the mortgage under the same exception;
       3° By the fulfilment of the formalities and conditions prescribed to third parties in possession to redeem the property
 which they have acquired;
       4° By prescription.
       Prescription is acquired to a debtor, as to the property which is in his hands, by the time prescribed by the statute of
 limitations in respect of the actions which give a mortgage or a prior charge.
       As to the property which is in the hands of a third party in possession, it is acquired by him by the time regulated for
 prescription of ownership for his benefit: in the case where prescription depends upon a title, it begins to run only from
 the day when that title has been recorded in the land registry of the situation of the immovables.
       Registrations made by a creditor do not interrupt the running of the prescription established by law in favour of the
 debtor or of the third party in possession.
       5° By the termination allowed by Article 2423, last paragraph and as far as provided for by this provision. [ex Art.
 2180 amended]

 OVER IMMOVABLES
 Articles 2510 to 2509
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 260/268
CIVIL CODE
 Article 2509
       In Mayotte, rights over immovables, prior charges and mortgages as well as the rules relating to the organization,
 establishment, transfer and extinguishment of rights in rem over immovables and other rights and deeds subject to
 registration are those of civil legislation  of ordinary law, subject to the provisions of this Title.
                CHAPTER I
                Of the System of Registration of Land Title
                        SECTION I
                        General Provisions
 Article 2510
 Articles 2510 to 2529
 Articles 2510 to 2515
       The registration of an immovable guarantees the right of ownership as well as any other right established in the title
 deed drawn up at the end of proceedings allowing the disclosure of the entirety of the rights already constituted over that
 immovable. The details of those proceedings shall be prescribed by decree in Conseil d'Etat.
 Article 2511
       Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article, the immovables of any nature, built or not, save those
 belonging to the public domain, shall be registered in the land-book of Mayotte specified in Article 2513. The transfers
 and constitutions of rights over those immovables shall be registered in the same book .
       Any unregistered immovable which is the subject of a sale in court shall be registered before the knocking down in
 the way provided for by decree in Conseil d'Etat.
       Plots of immovables upon which private tombs are built may be registered.
       Collective rights in rem sanctioned by custom are not subject to registration. Their being converted into individual
 rights of ownership allows registration of the immovable.
 Article 2512
       Registration of immovables and entry of the rights specified in Article 2521 in the land-book are compulsory
 whatever the legal status of the owner or of the holder of the rights may be.
       Irrespective of the reciprocal rights and claims of parties for the enforcement of their agreements, the rights
 specified in Article 2521 have effect as against third parties only where they have been given public notice by way,
 according to the circumstances, of registration or of entry in the land-book as provided for in this Chapter.
 Article 2513
       The land-book is constituted of the registers intended for giving public notice of rights over immovables.
       The land-book is kept by the land-book office. It may be run, by this office, under electronic form in the way provided
 for in Article 1316-1.
 Article 2514
       Registration of immovables and entry of the rights specified in Article 2521 takes place on application lodged in the
 way set out by decree in Conseil d'Etat.
       An advance entry may be made upon judgment with a view to insure its rank of entry to one of the rights specified in
 Article 2521 or to secure the effectiveness of a subsequent rectification.
 Article 2515
       A claim for recovery of a right over an immovable not disclosed during the proceedings of registration is
 inadmissible.
                        SECTION II
                        Of the Registration of Land Title and of its Effects
 Article 2516
       An immovable to register shall have first of all its boundaries marked out.
 Articles 2516 to 2520
       However, an owner, in agreement with the bordering owners, may waive the setting of boundaries.
       The boundary-stones belong to the owner whose immovable has its boundaries marked out.
 Article 2517
       Registration shall give rise to the establishment of a title-deed by the registrar of immovable property.
       A title-deed proves, as and when necessary, the status of owner.
       It shall constitute in court the starting point of the rights over an immovable at the time of the registration.
       Special title-deeds may be established after registration on application by the parties concerned.
 Article 2518
       An alteration of the title-deed after registration is evidence of the rights therein specified only until contrary proof.
 Article 2519
       A title-deed and its entries preserve  the right which  they relate as far as they have not been cancelled or altered
 and are evidence as against third parties that the person herein designated is vested with the rights herein specified.
 Article 2520
       Where he rejects an application for registration or is of opinion that he may not give effect to it, the registrar
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 261/268
CIVIL CODE
 forwards it to the court.
       It shall be the same where there exist objections or application for entry whose withdrawal in authentic form has not
 been given or to which the applicant refuses to assent.
       The court may order registration, wholly or partly, of the immovables as well as the entry of the real rights and
 encumbrances whose existence he has verified. He shall have rectified, if necessary, the setting of boundaries and the
 drawing of the immovable.
       The registrar shall establish the title-deed in accordance with the judgment which orders registration when it has
 become final, after possible rectification of the setting of boundaries and of the drawing of the immovable or compliance
 with the prescribed formalities.
                        SECTION III
                        Of the Registration of Rights over an Immovable
 Article 2521
 Articles 2521 to 2529
       Without prejudice to other rights whose entry is provided for by the provisions of this Code, of other Codes or of the

       e)  Superficie;

       g) Antichresis;
       h) The right in rem resulting from a title of occupation of the public domain of the State or of one of its public
 undertakings issued under the Code of the Domain of the State and of Public Authorities applicable in Mayotte;
       i) Prior charges and mortgages;
       2° Leases for a term of more than twelve years and, even as to a lease for a shorter term, the receipts or
 assignments of a duration equivalent to three years of rent or rent of farm not due;
       3) Rights subject to public notice under 1° and 2°, resulting from deeds or judgments establishing or deciding
 termination, revocation, annulment or rescission of an agreement or of a transfer mortis causa.
       However, servitudes which originate from the situation of the premises or which are established by law are
 exempted from entry.
 Article 2522
       Shall be entered on the land-book, on pain of inadmissibility, where they relate to the rights specified in Article 2521,
 1° and 2°, claims which are brought to obtain termination, revocation, annulment or rescission of an agreement or of a
 transfer mortis causa.
 Article 2523
       The holder of one of the rights specified in Article 2521 may not be entered before the right of his immediate
 predecessor in title has itself been  entered.
       The holder of a right other than ownership may only be entered after the owner of the immovable has been entered,
 save where the latter has been acquired by prescription or accession.
 Article 2524
       Any instrument relating to a right liable to being entered shall be, for the sake of entry, drawn up in authentic form by
 a notaire, a regular court or an administrative authority.
       Any transfer inter vivos, or transaction declaratory of ownership of immovable property, any transaction inter vivos
 creating or transferring a land servitude drawn up under another form shall be followed, under pain of lapse, by an
 authentic instrument or, in case of refusal of one party, by an application to the court, within six months following the
 drawing up of the instrument.
       The proof necessary for the instruments drawn up in authentic form in order to establish the rights transferred or
 created over a registered  immovable  shall be fixed by decree in Conseil d'Etat. This decree shall also fix the list of the
 documents to be filed in order to obtain the entry of rights in case of the opening of a succession.
 Article 2525
       Officiers ministériels and public authorities are under a duty to have entered, forthwith and irrespective of the
 consent of the parties, the rights specified in Article 2521 which result from instruments drawn up by themselves and
 specified in Article 2524.
 Article 2526
       Any person having an interest therein requests of the registrar the entry, cancellation or rectification of the entry of a
 right, by producing the instruments drawn up in authentic form and other documents whose filing is prescribed by this
 Title.
 Article 2527
       The registrar of immovable property or the court where the matter is brought before it, shall check whether the right
 Updated 04/04/2006 - Page 262/268
CIVIL CODE
 referred to in the application is liable to be entered, whether the instruments filed in support of the application comply
 with the prescribed form, and whether the predecessor in title of the right is himself entered in accordance with Article
 2523.
 Article 2528
       Where they have not been entered, rights subject to entry under Article 2521 are ineffective as against third parties
 who, over the same immovable, have acquired from the same predecessor in title, competing rights subject to entry.
       Where they have been entered, those rights are also ineffective where the rights alleged by those third parties, have
 been entered previously.
       However, third parties who themselves were in charge of having the competing rights entered may not avail
 themselves of that provision, nor may their universal successors .
 Article 2529
       Where several formalities which are likely to produce consequences effective as against third parties under Article
 2528, are requested on the same day over the same immovable, the one which is requested by virtue of the title-deed
 whose date is the oldest is deemed of a previous rank, whatever the order of the entered filings may be.
       Where a formality which is compulsory under Article 2521, 1° exclusive of i, and 2° and likely to produce
 consequences effective as against third parties under Article 2528, and an entry of a mortgage are requested on the
 same day over the same immovable, and the deed to be entered and the title of the entry bear the same date, the entry
 is deemed of a previous rank, whatever the order of the entered filings may be.
       Where competing formalities, which are compulsory under Article 2521, 1° exclusive of i, and 2° and likely to
 produce consequences effective as against third parties under Article 2528 are requested on the same day and the
 deeds to be published bear the same date, the formalities are deemed of the same rank.
       Where a formality likely to produce consequences effective as against third parties under Article 2528 and the entry
 of an order to pay deemed to be seizure are requested on the same day over the same immovable, the rank of the
 formalities is regulated, whatever the order of the entered filings may be, according to the dates, on the one hand, of the
 enforcement order specified in the order to pay, on the other hand, of the title of the competing formality; where the titles
 are of the same date, the entry of the order to pay deemed to be seizure is deemed to be of a preferable rank.
       In any case, the entries of separations of estates provided for in Article 2383, where Article 2386, paragraph 2, of
 the same Code so provides, as well as those of statutory mortgages provided for in Article 2400 (1°, 2° and 3°), are
